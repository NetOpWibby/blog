title: Being Brave: a Handshake retrospective

tldr:  What a mess

Earlier this week (2021.05.27), Michael Michelini of SkyInclude published[1] a
blog post where he laid claim that "Brave is asking for 3 to 3.5 million USD
for a 2 year of having Handshake names to work on their browserâ€¦It seems we
can 'bargain' it down to 3 million US dollars from the 3.5 million."

This information is not first-hand from Brave but rather "from multiple
sources that are high in the Handshake community."

The Handshake community is rather flat by nature so I can only surmise he
means 1) a group of people and 2) this group has big pockets. That only leaves
us with dWeb Foundation[2] and HNS Fund[3] as potential sources. I won't bury
the lede here. Over the last couple days, Michael has continuously refused to
answer direct questions. He has instead relied upon proxies in the form of a
link to a Twitter thread[4] that supports his actions and various cheerleaders
in the Namebase Discord that have "seen the conversations."

Those direct questions?

- Where did you get your information from?
- Who put you up to this?

From my perspective, if some deal was being discussed between Brave and
some "high" members of the community, why was Michael made privy to these
details? What was the motive of the participants to make details of the deal
public?

For his part, Brendan Eich (CEO of Brave) has rebuked the story[5] and asserts
the amount claimed was fake news[6].

From the Handshake Community[7] page:

> Every single person is a genuine and authorized Director of The Handshake
Project. If someone has given you a document or business card representing
themselves as a Director of The Handshake Project, they have full authority to
represent as Director of The Handshake Project with their own personal
viewpoint, So Please Treat Them Right. You, the reader, are also a Director of
The Handshake Project and have equal claim on authority, action,
and viewpoints.

> Any claims made by anyone on what Handshake does (or will do) does not
necessarily have the agreement of other participants in the community and
should not be seen as a definite certainty.

**As a Director of Handshake, I do not condone the actions of
Michael Michelini and I, quite frankly, do not trust him.** In fact, I deem
anything he publishes in the future as tabloid-esque bait to further his own
idealized position in the greater Handshake community.

To his credit, Michael published an update to the debacle he started andâ€¦well,
he didn't take ownership or explain himself. He instead recapped the situation
along with what Brendan shared on Twitter. I'll take that credit back.

From his update:

> But from all of this - Brendan, the co-founder and CEO of Brave has made an
amazing way to help us all deal with this awkward situation.

I don't like the framing of this. He tried to absolve himself of
responsibility. The situation is awkward because he made it that way.

His update also had this:

> There are groups trying to HELP the community - and some are not sure
when/if/how to communicate that information to the community at large.

More bullshit, IMHO. If I'm actively working to help a protocol gain traction,
what reason would I have to be secretive about it? This entire situation is
just about browser integration. Totally not high stakes at ALL. *Especially*
if I have "fuck you" amounts of money.

Yesterday he claimed[8] that "so many" have asked him "to step aside from the
HNS community" and that he'd step down if that's what it took to resolve this
situation. What's our favorite word? **Bullshit**.

There are three sides to every story: your side, their side, and the truth.

Brendan has already shared his side, amidst the digital shit thrown his way.
Michael has abused his goodwill with the community to get a mini army to do
his dirty work. Everyone involved should feel disrespected. Micahel caused
this situation and the communityâ€™s trust in him made us all look like petulant
children. What it takes to resolve this situation is to take accountability
but what does he do instead? Try to garner sympathy, and it actually worked!

Last bit from Michael's update:

> Sorry if I divided the community on this. I love Handshake.

If? IF?! ðŸ¤¡

The amount of sympathy/support Michael is getting in the Namebase Discord is
baffling. Truly, my mind is boggled. It is my belief that ignoring such
behavior only serves to legitimize it and encourage further breaches of trust.

Did we get an explicit acknowledge of what needs to be done to get native
Handshake resolution within Brave browser? Sure[9]. Did we have to harass a
CEO to get there? I think not. It is shameful that someone in our community
decided to implement a surreptitious marketing technique of the far right to
get a desired outcome, when a simple ask would've sufficed. Fake news? Really?

This post has mostly been a rant but I'm not a fan of complaining without at
least mentioning solutions, so here's where the productive part of the post
comes in. What can we (you) do moving forward?

- Don't believe everything you read on the Internet. Not even this post. *I*
  have good intentions but *you* don't know that. Luckily, I have link
  sources below.
- Hold people accountable. This is tricky because the Namebase Discord IS for
  Namebase, not Handshake directly but I dislike how people have decided to
  give Michael a pass.
- Educate yourself. From the comments directed towards Brendan it's clear to
  see that non-coders have a warped perspective on what it takes to build
  software, much less a browser. Balking at the idea that a browser maker
  would want, nay, EXPECT compensation for ongoing work (and maintenance) to
  integrate a new protocol is silly. Software has roadmaps and the one
  currency we all pay is time. Be patient and while you're waiting, do some
  reading to gain appreciation for the complexity involved.

Obviously, researching *everything* you read on the Internet is impractical to
do on a regular basis and hindsight is 20/20 but boyâ€¦we'd have a lot less egg
on our face. ðŸ•¸

P.S. Here's proof of various community members (along with myself) looking for
answers and finding nothing[10].

Update I: I just saw that after demanding details of the deal from Brendan,
Michael apologized to him and took ownership[11]. This was my main sticking
point. I only found this out by getting a link to the Handshake DNS Discord.
It would've been nice if Michael updated his blog post with this information.

Update II: I responded to the apology tweet with a comment stating Michael
should update his blog post with that. In my view, it would show closure.
Apparently, that sent Michael over the deep end and he refused to update his
post for reasons I don't understand. The Imgur link[10] has been updated with
screenshots so you can see for yourself without my flavor.
