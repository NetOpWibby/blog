This post is one part of a multi-post series about my first time trip to Japan. There are _so_ many things I discovered and experienced so to protect you from a novella-sized wall of text, I figured I'd break things up.

This particular post is a list of things I wish I knew or would have been neat to know. This is also in no particular order, I'm just offloading my brain.



### 7-Eleven
This place is awesome. Here in the States, I only ever visit 7-11 if it's Free Slurpee Day or I happen to pass by one (which is never because they aren't in places where I would walk). In Japan, they are _e v e r y w h e r e_. You'll want to visit these often for two reasons:

1. Good food/snacks at a great price.
2. ATMs that accept foreign debit cards.

Because you'll find yourself in situations where cash is king, having yen on hand is...well, handy.

When purchasing food that needs microwaving, the cashier will ask if you want that done at checkout. This was super useful for me, as I frequently visited 7-Elevens on the way back to my Airbnb/hostel/whatever. I now understand why Japan had the exclusive 7-Eleven items in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. If I knew back then what I know now, I'd have been even more jealous of the exclusivity.



### Bikes
Prepare for cardio.

I was unprepared for all the cycling we did. I'm 6'1", 150lbs, and lazy af. I mean, I walk everyday but I don't exercise _at all_.



### Post Office
I sent two boxes of stuff home after my first week and boy was it **expensive**. It was better than lugging everything around though so I ate that $200+ shipping fee.

In addition to being a great way to offload things you've purchased from Akihabara, the ATMs found in post offices allow you to withdraw money in any amount you want, unlike 7-Eleven (they have set amounts). Luckily, post offices are quite plentiful and allowed me to quickly withdraw more money so I could buy a kimono for my wife.



### Kimonos
If you're made of mega bucks and floss your teeth with threads from your Tesla's upholstery, look no further than the trendy Shibuya district and buy a brand new kimono for a couple hundred bucks. If you're a lowly commoner like myself (or you like saving money), I highly recommend visiting secondhand shops. We found one in Kyoto and I bought the first one I saw (it was literally on a mannequin by the entrance to the shop).



### Accommodations
This is purely anecdotal because I've only been in two hotels found on Booking.com but, the hotels are trash. In particular, hotels in the ... network. The pictures they list on Booking.com do **not** match what you actually get. Walls are scratched, mattresses have stains, drains smell _really_ bad (construction was being done next to one I was staying in, maybe that was the culprit?), and so on. It's worth noting that I got physical sick while staying at my first hotel. Maybe it was coincidence? I'm not sure, but I couldn't wait to get out of there.

The Airbnb we stayed during our first four days was _fantastic_ and based in Nagoya. There were two bikes offered out front, a 7-Eleven within walking distance, a train station not too far away, a ramen shop literally around the corner (I missed out on it though), and a dog park within biking distance.
