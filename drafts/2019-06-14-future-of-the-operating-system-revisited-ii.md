### [urbit](https://urbit.org)

Some choice quotes from Urbit:

> A personal server built from scratch.

> Your Urbit is a personal cloud server. A simple, private, general-purpose virtual computer on an encrypted P2P network.
>
> Your Urbit is your digital passport, your digital vault, and your digital assistant. You own it on Ethereum â€“ no one controls it but you.

Also Urbit:

> Today, you have two bad options for cloud computing: **run your own Unix server** or join a bunch of apps and services.
>
> We aren't going to take this deal. **We don't want to be system administrators** and we don't want to be ruled by some MEGACORP.
>
> So we built a new platform. A clean-slate stack simple enough that ordinary **people can run their own servers**.

Confusing selling points aside, it's actually a neat concept but still too jargon-y (for me) to fully comprehend.
