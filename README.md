# blog

> Welcome to Paul Anthony Webb's corner of the 'Net where he'll regale you with
> whatever he finds interesting.



## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NetOperatorWibby/blog.git && cd blog
npm i
```



## Scripts

All of these are self-explanatory. Your command prompt will let you know which
port the site is running on (3465 by default).

```sh
# run the site in production mode
npm start

# checks for module updates
npm run update

# run the site locally
npm run watch
```

The following command is not run manually, rather via a pre-commit hook. It
automatically updates the version parameter in my `package.json`, using
[ChronVer](https://chronver.org).

```sh
npm run increment
```



## Notes

- The text files have Markdown syntax for reasons:
  - I'm used to writing in Markdown
  - These files were converted from Markdown
  - I may create a Markdown renderer in the future
- Relative paths will be encased in arrow brackets:
  - example: </2019-12-02-a-personal-api.txt>
- Images are hosted on my CDN and you'll have to manually copy/paste to view:
  - example: https://ðŸ”¥.pixels.wtf/blog/image/2019/year-in-review-c.jpg
