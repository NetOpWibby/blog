[Back in 2013](https://2016.dsgn.io/thoughts/post/the-future-of-the-operating-system "The Future of the Operating System") I penned an essay titled, "The Future of the Operating System." In it, I attempted to predict where the operating system paradigm was headed based on what was obvious to me at the time: cloud services were taking off and mobile devices were seeing greater usage than personal computers. Logically, this meant the concept of a responsive OS was upon us. Some of the cited examples were [Firefox OS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS "Wikipedia article for Firefox OS") and [Ubuntu Edge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edge "Wikipedia article for Ubuntu Edge"), products that were designed to be a highly mobile primary computing device that would dock to an apparatus on one's desk to become a full-fledged workstation. The essay was also an opportunity to plug my OS _in-progress_ (now dormant), [hikari](https://hikar.io "hikari OS"), built around the responsive OS concept.

In the half-decade since, inventive minds have created truly fascinating UI concepts.

### [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui)

> eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.
>
> Heavily inspired from the [TRON Legacy movie effects](https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671) (especially the [Board Room sequence](https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room "TRON Board Room case study")), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be _"[DEX-UI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui "DEX UI repo") with less « art » and more « distributable software »"_. While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.

> Neo is a conceptual desktop operating system interface that is built for todays people, needs and technologies.

### [urbit](https://urbit.org)

Some choice quotes from Urbit:

> A personal server built from scratch.

> Your Urbit is a personal cloud server. A simple, private, general-purpose virtual computer on an encrypted P2P network.
>
> Your Urbit is your digital passport, your digital vault, and your digital assistant. You own it on Ethereum – no one controls it but you.

Also Urbit:

> Today, you have two bad options for cloud computing: **run your own Unix server** or join a bunch of apps and services.
>
> We aren't going to take this deal. **We don't want to be system administrators** and we don't want to be ruled by some MEGACORP.
>
> So we built a new platform. A clean-slate stack simple enough that ordinary **people can run their own servers**.

Confusing -stuff- aside, it's actually a neat concept but still too jargon-y to fully comprehend
