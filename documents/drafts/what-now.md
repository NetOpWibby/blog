The _schadenfreude_ I have been feeling of late is due to the public bashing of Facebook (and affiliates) by the media. I have long despised Facebook since learning eons ago what they do with user data. I have been without a Facebook-proper account for about two years now. I haven't uploaded anything to Instagram since January 1st and Iâ€™ve deleted the app from my phone. When my social network gains the ability to upload photos, I plan to write a script to import my Instagram photos to Socii and then delete my account.

Sounds like I have got it all figured out, right? Well, maybe. But, what about everyone else? What about the people who use Facebook Groups? How do you quit a platform when everyone you know is using it? I know people who hate the fact that their neighborhood/sports/support group manages everything in that platform, but they _have no other choice_.

**Facebook's superpower is that a whole lot of people are on their platform.** In 2018, I am not sure how one entices whole swathes of people to join a different social network (full disclosure, I am [the creator](https://hub.socii.network "Socii &there4; the social network") of one). Ease of use is the most important method of making any product or service appealing.

For all the talk of decentralization that has _also_ been happening lately, I do not think that enough people will rally behind it. I believe that most people are comfortable with centralization because there is a central authority they can point to, contact, &c, in the event of an issue or word-of-mouth.



### Can you #deletefacebook?

The #deletefacebook hashtag was all the rage for about two weeks but I am willing to bet that _most people_ either cannot or **will not** actually delete Facebook from their lives. The network effect is too strong in specific areas, like with groups. If your support group is only available within Facebook, you cannot leave if you want to stay in the loop. There are plenty of apps waiting in the rafters but I do not see Facebook Group admins at large advocating for movement off the platform.

As an aside, before I left Facebook I sent out a plea to my favorite group (for Deus Ex fans) to move to Reddit or Discord and the group admin simply "liked" my post. He was totally disinterested in leaving which I found pretty amusing because being a Deus Ex group, a fair amount of conspiracy theories ran amok. Here you have **proof** of a platform being evil and you choose to comply. This was two years ago, _maybe_ they would be up to leaving now.

Anyhoo, aside from Facebook's network effect being so damn powerful ("everyone is using it!"), the other major barrier to deleting Facebook is the question of where to _go_ and how to entice people to do so. I have not (yet) figured this out.
