When I was a kid, one of my sisters would say things to rile me up, like younger siblings tend to do. She'd create conflict, taunt me, and do whatever she could to drag me down with her. In one of my bouts of frustration my dad calmly presented me with an alternative way of thinking: ignore her. "It takes two people to argue. If you walk away, she looks crazy. Who argues with air?"

The smartphone market is a mess. **Vehement** anti-Apple folks gleefully ridicule Apple's design decisions and the "sheeple" who purchase Apple products while boasting about how great their Android (usually...most likely) handset maker of choice designs their products. The problem with this is, these same anti-Apple folks end up purchasing the upgraded model of their favorite phone and that phone, more often than not, looks like an iPhone. The hypocrisy is palpable but this article is not a knock against those people. The issue is the Android handset makers.
