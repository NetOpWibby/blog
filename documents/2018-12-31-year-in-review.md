So much has happened this year, not just for me but my wife as well. Let's dig in.<br/><br/>



### I quit Instagram
A year prior I quit Facebook proper but it seemed disingenuous to continue using Instagram. Knowing that I was still in FB Land made me feel gross so my last post was New Years Day.



### Attained Wakandan Citizenship
Black Panther was the greatest movie of the year. I want [Kimoyo Beads](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Kimoyo_Beads "Information about Kimoyo Beads") _badly_.



### Moved to Tennessee
Family friends invited us to stay with them while 1) I found a new job and 2) we found a home of our own. I **would not** recommend this as it was stressful in several annoying ways but it was only four months. Lessons learned?

- Trust your gut (in hindsight, I should have seen my layoff coming)
- Have a savings fund



### Got more serious about projects
[Socii](https://socii.network "My social network") saw improvements, [Chew](https://chew.sh "My analytics service") was launched, and I released some [open-source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vne "A clever .env") [modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chewit "Analytics you can count on") [and](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inc/eslint-config "Recommended ESLint settings for !NC projects") [configs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inc/sasslint-config "Recommended Sass Lint settings for !NC projects") on npm.

Along the way, I discovered better "good practices" and I'm keen on improving them further in the new year.

Oh, and I transitioned from GitLab to [Gitea](https://gitea.io "A painless self-hosted Git service"). GitLab is a resource hog and reminds of old Wordpress. I am much happier with Gitea and it is customizable! I haven't done any customization though, haha.

My wife delved into sewing more, improved her skills tenfold, and is becoming known in the sewing community. I now have intermediate knowledge about cover stiches and what stiches look like when using 1-3 needles.



### Bought more indie music
Stream life is just not for me, at least music-wise. Tidal, Spotify, Apple Music...none of it sticks with me. I've found myself using Bandcamp a lot more this year and I mean a LOT.

Some awesome musicians I've discovered are [LAKIM](https://lakimisalive.bandcamp.com), [ãƒžã‚¯ãƒ­ã‚¹MACROSS 82-99](https://macross82-99.bandcamp.com), [Eric Lau](https://ericlau.bandcamp.com), [Dent May](https://dentmay.bandcamp.com), [The PLAYlist](https://theplaylist.bandcamp.com), [leon chang](https://leyawn.bandcamp.com), [YUNG BAE](https://yungbaebae.bandcamp.com)...I could keep going but that small list should keep your ears busy for a couple hours.



### FIN
For the past couple years I've ended my annual review posts with my top nine popular Instagram posts but since I don't use that platform anymore...here are some favorited images from my phone.

This time next year, Socii will have photo functionality. ðŸ•¸
