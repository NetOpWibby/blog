My girlfriend and I are in competition to see who can read the most books this year. Before going through my list, let's have a look at my bookshelf.

![My bookshelf has more than books on it](🖼01.jpg)

As you can see, I have a **lot** going on. Eagle-eyed observers will see that some books have red dot stickers on them. Those are there to symbolize which books I have not read yet, or *started* but haven't finished. In alphabetical order, they are:

- ~~*1984* — George Orwell~~ [review](/thoughts/2017/1984-review)

That's 38 books in total. Of those, two of them aren't actually in my possession *yet*. *Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica Reissue* and *NES/Famicom: a visual compendium* are both Kickstarter-backed books that should be delivered sometime this year.

To hold myself accountable **and** make sure I retain the information I read, I'm going to do book reports on this blog which will basically be reviews. My girlfriend is going to do the same thing on [her blog](http://sincerelyshantelle.com "My girlfriend's blog, &ldquo;Sincerely Shantelle&rdquo;"), so be sure to check that out.

I am most excited to read *Count Zero* and *Mona Lisa Overdrive* because I absolutely **love** *Neuromancer* (all three of these books were written by William Gibson). I've read it a few times already. Funny story, while still in high school I visited a Border's bookstore (RIP) to buy Neuromancer. The store clerk thought I said "New Romancer" and wasted 10 minutes trying to find the incorrect book. In hindsight, I'm surprised that wasn't a real book in the store.

Anyhoo, the book I am reading right now is *A Culture of Innovation: Insider accounts of computing and life at BBN*. I am **fascinated** about the beginnings of the Internet. To think that it didn't always exist and now it's in the very fabric of our lives thanks in part to the people at *Bolt Beranek and Newman* is so cool to me. 🕸
