Earlier this summer, I had an interview with MailChimp for their MailChimp Agencies newsletter. Special shoutout goes to [Maurice Cherry](https://twitter.com/mauricecherry "The immaculate Maurice Cherry, on Twitter") for being the plug for this! If you don't know much about me and how I got started in the tech space, it's [a great read](https://mailchimp.com/resources/resources-for-partners/a-lesson-in-bouncing-back-from-web-designer-paul-anthony-webb "A Lesson in Bouncing Back from Web Designer Paul Anthony Webb").

Here are some excerpts from the interview, my tips on how to keep going:

- **Find someone who will collaborate with you.** "*Collaboration means you get someone else's experience,*" Webb says. "*It can also help you keep a realistic mindset of what's possible.*" A lack of knowledge combined with unrealistic expectations can be a toxic combination during any project. Collaborating with a partner can help you avoid those pitfalls.

- **Find value in seeing results.** "*One thing that motivates me is that I just want to see things happen,*" Webb says. "*If I have an idea and don't see anybody else doing it, then I'm going to do it just to see the result.*" Even if your project isn't going the way you hoped, there's still a lot that can be learned from seeing it through to the end.

- **Find a way to simplify.** "*Stuff takes on a life of its own sometimes,*" Webb says. "*There's usually a way to make it simpler. When a project gets too frustrating, I start to look for what I can strip away.*" When you feel overwhelmed, take a break and come back with a fresh eye toward how you can make things simpler. It may help breathe new life into your project.

Oh yeah, check out these dope illustrations of me by [Marco Boulais](http://www.marcoboulais.com "The portfolio of Marco Boulais"). I love them so much and I emailed him to get some commissioned stuff done, but haven't heard anything yet.
