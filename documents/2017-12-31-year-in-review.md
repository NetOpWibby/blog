Keeping with the tradition of reviewing my year, let's have a look back at my 2017.



### I visited Japan
My buddy Jamar had the bright idea to order plane tickets to Japan in December of last year for September of this year. Of course, I paid him back within the first four months of 2017. Anyhoo, we stayed for two weeks (my other buddy Oliver stayed for a week) and it was one of _the_ best experiences of my life. Holy moly. I still have a LOT of footage to get through. I've been meaning to post about my trip for quite some time but 60GB+ is too much to go through...or maybe I'm just lazy. Here's a couple pics to whet your appetite:

### I proposed and got married
During Easter I proposed to my longtime girlfriend and although we planned an semi-elaborate wedding, we decided to make it a small get-together. After all, we were financing things ourselves so it made the most sense. This was another great experience, especially because the weather leading up to and immediately after our wedding day was absolutely _dreadful_ and cold. We took that as a sign of the universe approving our union.

If you're interested in learning how we met, you can check out both [her post](http://sincerelyshantelle.com/blog/how-i-met-my-husband "How my wife met me") and [mine](/2017/how-i-met-my-wife "How I met my wife").



### I lost my job
The startup I was working for went out of business in November. This was a mere _four days_ after my wedding. ðŸ¤¬ Yeah I know, fun right? Christmas a month later too? **Good grief**! Studies show that money is one of the major reasons behind divorce so I guess my wife and I were lucky that this happened immediately. Even though job searching is immensely stressful (and annoying), having ample time to work on projects I reserved for nights and weekends has been a plus.

Let this be a lesson to you: if you work for a startup that's focused _solely_ on B2B and they poo-poo the idea of B2C for additional revenue even though their big partners are moving slower than molasses, _flee as soon as you can_. That big partner can **and will** outlive your dinky startup.



### Became more productive
This was a direct result of losing my job. Per my post about [neglected projects](/2017/neglected-projects "A post about my neglected projects"), I went through the list and either redesigned or sunset them. My sunset'd projects aren't 100% gone, just positioned in a way that I don't feel bad about seeing them. A great way to ensure that is to get your project(s) to a nice stopping point _and_ leave yourself notes.

With those out of the way, I started work on a social network called Socii. You can [read more about](/2017/who-creates-social-networks "Who creates social networks?") it or [visit the site](https://socii.network "Socii, the social network") to sign up for updates!



### FIN
Here's my top nine Instagram photos, based on likes.

This may be the last time I do one of these, I want Socii to replace Instagram for me. ðŸ•¸
