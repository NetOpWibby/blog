  <p>Welcome to the most fantabulous blog on the Internet! My name is Paul Anthony Webb, and I am a Boston-based front-end web <a href="https://dsgn.io" title="My portfolio">designer and developer</a> making awesome things (for awesome people).</p>

  <p>I am a proud lefty, Aries, and <a href="https://weom.space" title="My space-centric lifestyle brand">space bandit</a>. The only pencil I trust is a Ticonderoga. I was born on Easter Sunday, 1988 (not religious, but it’s an interesting anecdote). I used to be an "Army-brat". My parents despised video games while I was growing up, so I am making up for it now. <a href="http://frsh.fm" title="My music">I make music</a> under various aliases, the most used being "the Wibby" (followed by FRSH&times;BTS and Spaceman Fresh). MUJI is life and Uniqlo is dope af.</p>

  <p>I created this blog because there were many things I wanted to write about, but the content didn't make sense on my only blog <a href="https://2016.dsgn.io/thoughts" title="My old blog">at the time</a>. At the same time, the <code>.blog</code> TLD was announced and the timing was perfect to start something new.</p>

  <p>Every day brings about new opportunities, inspiration, and kick-ass “whoah” moments. Spread the love and do your part by inspiring others as you’ve been inspired!</p>

  <p><strong>(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ</strong> That's what I try to do anyway.</p>

  <p>My girlfriend has a blog that she updates semi-regularly. If you, or someone you know, likes to read about mom life and/or creating crafts, <a href="http://sincerelyshantelle.com" title="Lakeisha Shantelle's blog">check her out</a>!</p>
