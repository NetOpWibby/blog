Earlier this summer, I had an interview with MailChimp for their MailChimp
Agencies newsletter. Special shoutout goes to Maurice Cherry[1] for being the
plug for this! If you don't know much about me and how I got started in the
tech space, it's a great read[2].

Here are some excerpts from the interview, my tips on how to keep going:

- *Find someone who will collaborate with you.* "*Collaboration means you get
  someone else's experience,*" Webb says. "*It can also help you keep a
  realistic mindset of what's possible.*" A lack of knowledge combined with
  unrealistic expectations can be a toxic combination during any project.
  Collaborating with a partner can help you avoid those pitfalls.

- *Find value in seeing results.* "*One thing that motivates me is that I just
  want to see things happen,*" Webb says. "*If I have an idea and don't see
  anybody else doing it, then I'm going to do it just to see the result.*" Even
  if your project isn't going the way you hoped, there's still a lot that can
  be learned from seeing it through to the end.

- *Find a way to simplify.* "*Stuff takes on a life of its own sometimes,*"
  Webb says. "*There's usually a way to make it simpler. When a project gets
  too frustrating, I start to look for what I can strip away.*" When you feel
  overwhelmed, take a break and come back with a fresh eye toward how you can
  make things simpler. It may help breathe new life into your project.

Oh yeah, check out these dope illustrations of me by Marco Boulais[3]. I love
them so much and I emailed him to get some commissioned stuff done, but haven't
heard anything yet.
