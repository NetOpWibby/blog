tldr:  Easiest tutorial for adding TLS to a Handshake site, with Caddy.
---

For the uninitiated, Handshake[1] is a protocol intended to
embrace (and ideally extinguish) legacy DNS. If that statement scares you, it
makes sense. Drastic change is alarming. Yes, there is a blockchain involved
but we're not going to get into that. You came here because
you 1) have a Handshake TLD and 2) you have a site you want to use on it.

Caddy[2], by default, automatically issues TLS certificates via LetsEncrypt but
LE is a centralized certificate authority and doesn't know what Handshake is.
Not to worry, we'll generate our own secure certificates with
OUR OWN CA (via light-ca[3])! After that we'll update our Caddyfile and
reload/restart the server to test and finalize our changes. Easy-peasy.

For this tutorial I'll be using my TLD starbase/. Rather than make the root
domain resolve to a site, I'm opting to use an SLD (second-level domain)
instead (so, welcome.starbase in this example). You should be familiar with DNS
and managing servers before continuing. Without further ado, let's begin!

01. SFTP your site content to your VPS

02. SSH into VPS and install light-ca
```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/light-river/light-ca/releases/download/latest/light-ca.tar.gz | tar zx && sudo mv ./light-ca /usr/bin/light-ca
```

03. Create certs
```sh
light-ca --domains "welcome.starbase"
```

04. Update Caddyfile
```txt
welcome.starbase {
  # This is the path to a folder on my server that holds the site code
  root * /var/www/starbase/
  encode gzip
  file_server
  # This is the path to the certs created by light-ca
  # The paths I chose are not the defaults.
  # Syntax: tls <path to cert.pem> <path to key.pem>
  tls /var/custom-certs/welcome.starbase/cert.pem /var/custom-certs/welcome.starbase/key.pem
}
```

05. Reload Caddy and check for issues
```sh
systemctl reload caddy
# If there are no issues, run next command
systemctl restart caddy
```

06. Finally, add A record to TLD DNS (via Namebase[4]) with VPS' IP address.

I'm assuming you're using NextDNS[5], hDNS[6], or some other method of natively
viewing Handshake domains on your device. If so, enter https://<your-site> in
your favorite browser to view your "hard" work.

Seriously, this was so easy. ðŸ•¸



P.S. I'm building a registry AND a registrar for my collection of
Handshake TLDs. If you want updates on when they launch, follow @neuenet[7] and
@beachfront_[8] respectively. The launch is slated for end of summer.
