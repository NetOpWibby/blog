As I'm writing this, I just remembered that I planned to launch V2 at the end
of April. I did it!

Please give it an upvote on ProductHunt[1]!

Over the past 24 hours, I've been taking in early feedback ranging from UI, UX,
and backend issues. As you can imagine, there's still a lot to do.

Here's a list of what you can currently do as a user:

- import/export domains (a template is provided[2] for importing).
- add domains and registrar/expiration info will automatically get
  added (in most cases)
- add wishlist domains

Not a huge list but I think the main draw will be the personal analytics. To my
knowledge, no other registrar does this and they *certainly* don't allow you to
see the domains you have registered elsewhere. Here is what you can expect to
see after adding domains:

ðŸ“¸[Analytical shot of BeachfrontDigital][IMG3]

- a conversational readout of your domain portfolio
  - total number of domains
  - number of domains renewing this month
  - number of domains renewing this year
  - number of domains renewing next year
  - total number of TLDs (the text after the period in URLs, `.com`, `.net`,
    `.space`, &c)
  - total number of registrars (the companies you buy your domains from)
  - your favorite registrar
  - your favorite TLD
  - total amount of money you're spending annually to renew your domains
  - your cheapest domain
  - your most expensive domain

You can also see this data in chart form, which is arguably *much* more
impressive-looking. Currently, the visual data displays:

- the number of domain renewals occurring per month
- the amount of money you're paying per month
- the amount of money you pay each registrar per year
- the number of domains you've registered per registrar
- the amount of domains you own per TLD

Those screenshots above are from my own domain portfolio and I can gleam some
interesting information from the dataâ€¦

- I already knew this, but most of my domains come from Tucows, the parent
  company of Hover.
- Three times a year, I seem to get a burst of inspiration and buy domain
  names. Also, I need to check what month it is before buying something
  extravagant.
- My favorite TLDs are `.online` and `.com` (my first domain name was
  `pw-software.com` and it's still live to this day).

Anyhoo, all this to say that V2 of BeachfrontDigital is live and available at
beachfront.digital[3]. Check it out and let me know what you think! ðŸ•¸
