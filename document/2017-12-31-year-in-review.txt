Keeping with the tradition of reviewing my year, let's have a look back at my
2017.



## I visited Japan
My buddy Jamar had the bright idea to order plane tickets to Japan in December
of last year for September of this year. Of course, I paid him back within the
first four months of 2017. Anyhoo, we stayed for two weeks (my other buddy
Oliver stayed for a week) and it was one of *the* best experiences of my life.
Holy moly. I still have a LOT of footage to get through. I've been meaning to
post about my trip for quite some time but 60GB+ is too much to go throughâ€¦or
maybe I'm just lazy. Here's a couple pics to whet your appetite:

## I proposed and got married
During Easter I proposed to my longtime girlfriend and although we planned an
semi-elaborate wedding, we decided to make it a small get-together. After all,
we were financing things ourselves so it made the most sense. This was another
great experience, especially because the weather leading up to and immediately
after our wedding day was absolutely *dreadful* and cold. We took that as a
sign of the universe approving our union.

post[1] and mine[2].



## I lost my job
The startup I was working for went out of business in November. This was a
mere *four days* after my wedding. ðŸ¤¬ Yeah I know, fun right? Christmas a
month later too? *Good grief*! Studies show that money is one of the major
reasons behind divorce so I guess my wife and I were lucky that this happened
immediately. Even though job searching is immensely stressful (and annoying),
having ample time to work on projects I reserved for nights and weekends has
been a plus.

Let this be a lesson to you: if you work for a startup that's focused *solely*
on B2B and they poo-poo the idea of B2C for additional revenue even though
their big partners are moving slower than molasses, flee as soon as you can.
That big partner can *and will* outlive your dinky startup.



## Became more productive
This was a direct result of losing my job. Per my post about neglected
projects[3], I went through the list and either redesigned or sunset them. My
sunset'd projects aren't 100% gone, just positioned in a way that I don't feel
bad about seeing them. A great way to ensure that is to get your project(s) to
a nice stopping point *and* leave yourself notes.

With those out of the way, I started work on a social network called Socii.
You can read more about[4] it or visit the site[5] to sign up for updates!



## FIN
Here's my top nine Instagram photos, based on likes.

This may be the last time I do one of these, I want Socii to replace Instagram for me. ðŸ•¸
