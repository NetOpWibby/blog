tldr:  Introduction to this humble blog.

Welcome to theWebb.blog[1]! I am your host, the *most fantabulous* Paul Anthony
Webb a/k/a NetOperator Wibby (virtually everywhere else on the vast Internet).
What can you expect from theWebb.blog? Basically anything that comes out of my
head and holds my attention long enough to be written about.

I thought about porting the posts from my previous blog[2], but I'd rather
start fresh. After all, after the *tumultuous* year that was 2016, I think we
could *all* use a fresh start.

As a professional front-end web designer and developer, I thought about
creating a beautiful theme to showcase my dope skills but I tend to go
overboard and never release things. I'm aiming to change that. I was also going
to write my own blogging platform after my frustration and false start with
Ghost[3] but then I found Hexo[4] (shoutout to the creator of NX framework[5]
for the recommendation)!

Long story short, I intend to stick around with this blog for quote some time.
Fancy upgrades and whatnot will happen over the next year and years after that.
Kottke[6] has been blogging since 2008. I graduated high school in 2006!
*Crazy*.

I hope you'll find my little area on the Internet of interest at least a few
times. ðŸ•¸
