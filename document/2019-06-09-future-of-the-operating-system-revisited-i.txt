Back in 2013[1] I penned an essay titled, "The Future of the Operating
System." In it, I attempted to predict where the operating system paradigm was
headed based on what was obvious to me at the time: cloud services were taking
off and mobile devices were seeing greater usage than personal computers.
Logically (to me), this meant the concept of a responsive OS was upon us. Some
of the cited examples were Firefox OS[2] and Ubuntu Edge[3], products that
were both designed to be highly mobile primary computing devices that would
dock to an apparatus on one's desk to become a full-fledged workstation. The
essay was also an opportunity to plug my OS in-progress (now dormant),
hikari[4], built around the responsive OS concept.

For now, a rectangular slab of glass and metal that more or less fits in the
palm of an adult hand appears to be the preferred format for a mobile
computing device. Specific details and component internals can and will change
but the external *probably* won't change much so no time will be spent talking
about that. Instead, I'll go over my favorite UI concepts that inventive minds
have created in the half-decade since my inital opus.



## eDEX-UI[5]

The on-screen keyboard suggests the use of this UI on a large touchscreen
table (like Microsoft's PixelSense[9] or Oblivion's Light Table[10]) or at
least the 12" iPad Pro. Despite what some would consider "visual noise", this
UI has almost everything one would need for text entry and multitasking.

I personally don't see myself using a UI like this because of limited color
palette. It looks wonderful for focus though.

If nothing else, it is fun to look at and pretend you're in a future where
hoverboards are actually real and not ðŸ¤¬ batteries on wheels.



## Desktop Neo[11]

This UI is all about fullscreen EVERYTHING. Window manager lovers would be
so into this (looking at you, /r/unixporn[12] community). Heck, *I* am into
this! All day every day I am CONSTANTLY resizing/swiping/moving windows
around.

The panel concept of this UI is nice and the search functionality sounds like
something I *need*. I am currently on the beta for macOS Catalina and it
*almost* has the concept down but you can only split two windows, max.

I do like how productive it makes me feel so maybe I'll become a heavy user of
it (and hope Apple expands on the feature). Of the UI concepts showcased here,
Desktop Neo is my favorite.



## Mercury[13]

This is interesting because it completely strips away the desktop paradigm and
creates something that aims to intuit what you'll do based on previous
interactions. Basically, local machine learning to help you be more
productive.

Mercury makes *heavy* use of shortcuts and search to get around, so this isn't
the UI for the faint of heart.

The mockups show email messages and some neat things around that but nothing
else. It'd be interesting to see how a web browser would look. How do I see
all my apps? The creator of Mercury says there aren't any apps but come on,
OF COURSE there are.

I'm excited to see where Mercury heads but for now, it just looks like a nice
email app.



## Thoughts

A key issue I have with every UI concept mentioned here (and nearly every one
on the Internet) is the lack of real work being done within them. Outside of
an email or text prompt, you rarely see how a coder would use it. Or an
analyst. Or a designer. Or anyone being productive, period.

A common thread that brings these concepts together is, *focus*. Another is
change (obviously). After all, the desktop metaphor[14] as we know it was
created in 1970. *Nineteen seventy*. What you are reading right now was
written in 2019, nearly 50 YEARS later andâ€¦not much has changed.

As I am wont to do, I think about lapsed projects of mine and wonder what
would warrant further development. In hikari's case, it doesn't make sense to
simply recreate the tried-and-true desktop metaphor. If my aim is to solve
problems inherent to a dated paradigm, keeping with the status quo is NOT the
way to go.

One of the reasons Apple's iOS is massively popular is because users don't
have to think about files and folders, a chief tenant of the desktop paradigm.

Soâ€¦where do we go from here?

I don't pretend to have the answer but I think we're *slowly* going in the
right direction. ðŸ•¸
