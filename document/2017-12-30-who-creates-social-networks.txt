Or, "Social networks are terrible, so I'm creating one". But‚Ä¶why? *Excellent*
question, buckle up gang!

Social networks in 2017 are just *bad*. There's no shortage of articles
written about how depressing, manipulative, greedy, and morally bankrupt they
are but, to what end? The same people writing about these horrid networks
continue to use them because *despite* all the horrible things done (or
ignored) by the creators to their users, these networks have *utility*. At
their very core, social networks bring people together and double as support
groups for like-minded thinkers (for better or worse). There's (seemingly) no
incentive for the networks to make things better on behalf of their users.
Where else are they (the masses) gonna go? Mastodon? Micro.blog? Sublevel?
Scuttlebutt? HAH!

"Big Social" knows *damn well* that the average user (read: at least 70% of
them) isn't going to:

1. Create a DigitalOcean, or other VPS (virtual private server) provider
   account
2. Pay *money* for a server (even though the cheapest is $5)
3. Read a tutorial on GitHub for instructions on how to set up their own
   Mastodon instance
4. Invite their friends and family
5. Maintain the server and *continue* paying $5/month for it

You wanna know what my friends did after I told them I was deleting my
Facebook account at the top of this year? Some responded with a disaffected,
"oh". Some were appalled at the privacy violations they unknowingly subjected
themselves to daily yet continued scrolling their feed. Others just didn't
care. Now we get to the reason social networks are just *bad* and will
continue to be: The masses simply do not give a rat's ass, flying fuck, and/or
shit. Womp womp.

To my wife's credit, she mainly uses Facebook for the mom/support groups she's
found. All those moms aren't going to a transition to a Discord server or
subreddit because the *experience* will be too jarring and that'll make the
transition unlikely to stick.

To be quite honest, *I am not much better*. I mean sure, I quit Google because
of their ever-increasing invasiveness to my privacy and selling my user data
to advertisers. I now self-host my email (shout out to Mail-in-a-Box[1]).
But‚Ä¶I created a new Google account so I could still use YouTube (thinking
about deleting it again and manually keeping track of favorite channels but
MEHHHHH).

I complain about Twitter *on* Twitter and guess what? I tweet like a *mofo*. I
retweet even more! I favorite! I am *disgusted* by the fact that they utilize
Drumpf in their advertisements overseas while pretending that they cannot hold
the current U.S. president to the same standards as everyone else. I am
disgusted by the way they *enable* Nazi propaganda while simultaneously
blocking such content in Germany and France. I am disgusted by the way they
effectively *shit* on their users being attacked and for some strange reason,
*side with the oppressors/attackers*. And yet‚Ä¶it's the best damn version
of social media I've been on to date and that does *not* make me happy. At
some point though, you've got to stop complaining and *take action*.

üì∏[Socii logo and logotype][IMG1]

Introducing *Socii* ("Oh great, another social network," you think), my answer
to the bullshit perpetuated by Big Social and the absence of an easily
accessible alternative (pronounced \\'s≈ç-'kƒì\\).

Like Big Social, you'll be able to:
- add a profile picture
- have an accent color
- post updates

*Un*like Big Social, you'll be able to:
- play with a crap ton more customization options (top secret for now)
- use tools to customize and protect your online experience
- read your timeline untouched by algorithms

"This sounds good," you say, "but how will you make money? I'm not paying for
a social network!"

Well damn, you're stingy but okay *I get it*. There will be a merchandise
shop, account upgrades like the ability to secure a three/four character
username, and something else related to the top secret customization options
mentioned above. Furthermore, there will be a way for users to make a bit of
cash themselves. It is my hope that this will be enough to keep Socii going
once the free tier limits on some services I'm using to operate it start
costing money.

To temper expectations (if only for myself), I do not expect Socii to become
"the one true network" but I would be *delighted* if people found it to be a
welcome reprieve and community of good vibes. A private alpha will occur in
early 2018 with a beta slated for (hopefully) late summer. I'll bring people
in on a rolling basis at that point. If you'd like to be notified once early
registration opens up, feel free to sign up at socii.network[2]! üï∏
