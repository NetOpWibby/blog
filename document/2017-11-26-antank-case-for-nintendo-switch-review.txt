That's what it says on the box anyway. Does it live up to it's lofty goal? Read
on to find out!



## Aesthetic

The outside of the case has a matte finish that feels *quite* good. The back has
two release mechanisms that expand the case vertically to allow insertion of
your Switch. Below both mechanisms are kickstands with three levels of recline.
I only used them while testing as I prefer to use handheld mode on the go.
There certainly isn't any space for kickstand mode on the MBTA! Near the bottom
of the case are holes for the Switch's heat vents and a power button followed
by four thunderbolts to signify how much charge is available. They alight blue
when charging. The top of the case hides a compartment for storing two Switch
games horizontally. The side of the case features USB-C charging. YUS!



## Portability

The case by itself doesn't weigh much but when you insert the Switch, you can
*definitely* notice the difference (if you play in handheld mode often). I was
able to squeeze my Switch and case inside a fanny pack but it was a tight fit.
Don't expect this to work with your nifty Super Mario Odyssey slipcase, that
ain't happening. *Of course*, you could always store the battery case itself in
the drawstring bag that comes with it.



## Real-world Usage
I didn't measure the charge time for the case itself but it's roughly an hour
and a half to two hours. I used my MacBook Pro power brick to charge so I'm not
sure if that made a difference versus the default power brick it comes with.
During my playtest with Super Mario Odyssey, I noticed the case didn't recharge
my Switch…it basically kept it from dying and was effectively a portable
wall-charger. I assume graphically-intensive games prevent charging AND battery
replenishment so that was a little discouraging. I got *at least* a half-hour
of extended playtime thanks to this charger though and that's what counts.



## Should you buy this?
If you play your Switch a LOT while nowhere near a USB-C charger, absolutely. I
can see this being a *great* addition to any traveler as well. I wish I had
this with me in Japan for the bullet train rides, I was using the available
socket to me for charging my computer. Also, China Southern Airlines did not
have appropriate sockets for me to charge my computer. Instead of sleeping to
pass the time, I could've been playing Mr Shifty or Zelda.

Even for occasional travel, having a Switch charger that envelopes the system
is a great idea. I have an Anker USB-C charger and it's a brick. Sure, I can
charge my Switch with it but it's unwieldy and it *sucks* dealing with cables.
I'm loving the one port life with as little cables as possible and Antank made
that a little bit bearable. You can buy the Antank charger on Amazon[1]
for $47.

If you have an existing USB-C charger and don't care about having a case that
fits your Switch, there is absolutely no need to get this. It's more of a
convenience thing, not a necessity. 🕸



## P.S.
- I was approached by a representative for Antank to purchase and review their
  charger. I was refunded after purchasing.
- It occurs to me that I never tested how much the case would recharge my
  Switch while it was turned *off*. I'll get on that and update this post.
