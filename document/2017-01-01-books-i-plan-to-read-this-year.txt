My girlfriend and I are in competition to see who can read the most books this
year. Before going through my list, let's have a look at my bookshelf.

ðŸ“¸[My bookshelf has more than books on it][IMG1]

As you can see, I have a *lot* going on. Eagle-eyed observers will see that
some books have red dot stickers on them. Those are there to symbolize which
books I have not read yet, or *started* but haven't finished. In alphabetical
order, they are:

- 1Ì¶9Ì¶8Ì¶4Ì¶ Ì¶â€”Ì¶ Ì¶GÌ¶eÌ¶oÌ¶rÌ¶gÌ¶eÌ¶ Ì¶OÌ¶rÌ¶wÌ¶eÌ¶lÌ¶lÌ¶ [1]

That's 38 books in total. Of those, two of them aren't actually in my
possession *yet*. "Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica Reissue" and
"NES/Famicom: a visual compendium" are both Kickstarter-backed books that
should be delivered sometime this year.

To hold myself accountable *and* make sure I retain the information I read,
I'm going to do book reports on this blog which will basically be reviews. My
girlfriend is going to do the same thing on her
blog[3], so be sure to check that out.

I am most excited to read "Count Zero" and "Mona Lisa Overdrive" because I
absolutely *love* "Neuromancer" (all three of these books were written by
William Gibson). I've read it a few times already. Funny story, while still in
high school I visited a Borders bookstore (RIP) to buy Neuromancer. The store
clerk thought I said "New Romancer" and wasted 10 minutes trying to find the
incorrect book. In hindsight, I'm surprised that wasn't a real book in the
store.

Anyhoo, the book I am reading right now is "A Culture of Innovation: Insider
accounts of computing and life at BBN". I am *fascinated* about the
beginnings of the Internet. To think that it didn't always exist and now it's
in the very fabric of our lives thanks in part to the people at
"Bolt Beranek and Newman" is so cool to me. ðŸ•¸
