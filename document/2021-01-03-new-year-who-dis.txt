I'm not going to mention last year in number, I don't even want to hear people
with perfect vision talk about their eyes. We're in a new year, Drumpf is going
to be out of office in less than three weeks, and I have a new design for my
blog...more like, LACK of design.



## Why

I published a grand total of two posts last year. TWO. I was busy working on
personal projects, dealing with this general malaise of uncertainty, and didn't
feel like dealing with the annoying process of updating my blog. Yuk. As a
result though, I have several half-finished posts I can/will upload this year
since my blog setup is extremely pared down.

Being an architech (a designer who codes and vice-versa) is hella annoying. I
am displeased by my design AND my code after a period of time, and then I
detest it far too much. Maybe my experience and age has brought me to the point
of realizing I don't need the latest fancy UI bÌ¶lÌ¶eÌ¶mÌ¶iÌ¶sÌ¶hÌ¶eÌ¶sÌ¶ features and tooling to
get something online. I *may* update this to support TypeScript and `import`s
because I quite enjoy that.

This blog is also missing analytics. They were never on the front-end, but in
the server. One of my many tasks this year is to overhaul my analytics
platform[1] to make it robust enough to charge money for.



## What (now)

I think adding automated deployments would be a nice quality-of-life feature
and would definitely encourage me to write more. Currently, I have to upload a
new text file to my server and refresh the pm2 job. In any event, this blog is
the first step in realizing my personalOS[2] concept in concrete forms and I
suppose this is the year to document everything as I go through it.

You can check out the previous[3] incarnation of this blog if you're curious to
see what it was like.

I think 2021 is gonna be big for data portability and flat files are the
easiest way to do it. The fact that this blog is just a single JavaScript file
and a folder full of text files (okay AND a couple Node.js modules ðŸ˜’) is kind
of neat...actually, that wouldn't be a bad idea for socii[4] to implement.
Maybe I'll relaunch that soon. We'll see. ðŸ•¸
