tldr:  Looking back on the awesome things that's happened to me in 2016.

Last year, I decided to look back[1] on everything I've learned/achieved and
it was a great reflective experience. So, here it is again for 2016!



## Became a father to a newborn
I was already a dad but I've never experienced taking care of a *brand new*
life. I was worried that my son wouldn't like me and other silly non-sensical
things like that. In reality, it is *super* challenging at times but he's a
happy boy who has no problem falling asleep in my arms. And biting me. And
farting on me. Needless to say, he's super comfortable with his papa. üòÅ

## Moved all my projects to GitLab
After running my own email server for half a year, I wondered why I was
*still* paying GitHub for private repos. What they cÃ∂hÃ∂aÃ∂rÃ∂gÃ∂eÃ∂dÃ∂ used to charge
didn't make sense so I set up a personal GitLab instance[2] and I couldn't be
happier. I have unlimited private repos for *$40/month* (my server has
*4GB of RAM* and *60GB of storage*). Because you can never be too sure, I have
backups enabled for *$8/month*.



## Moved all my email to Mail-in-a-Box
Just like with GitHub, I didn't understand why I was paying Hover $200/year
for hosting my email when I *already* had a Mail-in-a-Box[3] instance hosting
one[4] of my them. Thankfully, it's relatively easy[5] to add multiple domains
to the same box. It currently costs me *$10/month* for *unlimited* email
accounts versus $200/year for merely 10 (my server has *1GB of RAM* and
*30GB of storage*).



## Released a SaaS product
I buy a lot of books on Amazon and never get around to reading them. That
wasn't the case with The 7 Day Startup[6]. After reading the book (it was a
quick read), I was super motivated to bring an idea (I sat on for about a
year) to life. That idea was BeachfrontDigital[7], a domain portfolio
management tool. My market focus is quite niche, it's for people who buy
multiple domains from multiple registrars. The problem I am solving involves
keeping track of all your domains and renewal dates. Some TLDs also renew 30
days before expiration and I intend to include this kind of information in V2.
I've gotten some great feedback and I look forward to enhancing the service
in 2017.

Related to releasing BeachfrontDigital, I learned how to use Feathers.js[8]
more, used MongoDB[9] and mongoose[10] for the first time, and in production
(I love them both now), and other back-end web development things. I'm a firm
believer that side projects are key to learning new things. Your day job most
likely won't challenge you to try drastically different things from what
you're used to, which can stifle your personal growth.



## Hosted my first pop-up shop
My clothing brand WE√ñM[11] had a pop-up shop in one of WeWork
South Station's conference rooms. Along with my friend Angel[12], we had fun
collaborating on 2017 collections when we weren't chatting with people who
stopped by. It was a *great* learning experience! In the time since, I've
decided to transition/rebrand WE√ñM to become a space-centric lifestyle brand
instead of being *just* a clothing brand. There's still a lot of work to be
done, but look forward to visiting the new world I'm building around it!

## Had my first interview
Revision Path[13] is a weekly interview podcast, Patreon[14], and Slack
group[15] that I've been a fan of for quite some time. The host, Maurice
Cherry[16], likes to interview people on the come up doing interesting things.
So, imagine my surprise when he asked to interview *me*! We tried recording
while I was in my apartment but houses in Massachusetts are old so my
microphone was picking AM radio signals. üòí I wasn't hearing that weirdness
but Maurice is in Atlanta and was hearing ads for Harvard, lol! Long story
short, we had to reschedule and the interview will be out in January. *Great*
way to start off the new year!



## Published my first module to npm
My module is called `hexo-render-sass` and I made it before realizing that
similar modules exist‚Ä¶oh well (it doesn't help that the official Hexo
site[17] fails to list Sass plugins on the site). It was another great
learning experience and it took away the mystic mumbo jumbo I associated npm
modules with. You can find it here[18].



## And that's it!
I'll end this post with my best nine Instagram photos of 2016, according to
Lip Inc[19]. üï∏
