title: I'm done with Kickstarter

tldr:  Being let down all the time is…a let down.

Kickstarter is a great place for people to financially support those with a
great idea and a prototype, but need a little assistance to make that idea a
reality. This is why I signed up for the platform in 2012. Five years later
and I'm sick of the bullshit that seems to emanate from the projects I back.

Of the 39 projects I have contributed money to, 10 are delayed (some are
delayed by about a year or more). *Good thing I'm not holding my breath.*
Let's take a look at those projects, starting with the oldest.



## Star Citizen
📸[Star Citizen on Kickstarter][IMG1]

This game[1], by Cloud Imperium Games Corporation, was successfully funded on
November 19th, 2012. I backed at the $37 tier (Digital Scout) for:

- a digital copy of the finished game (PC)
- RSI Aurora spaceship ready to fly
- 1,000 Galactic Credits
- exclusive access to the Alpha + Beta

The estimated delivery date for this was November 2014. Of the unfulfilled
projects I backed, I am the *least* sore about Star Citizen because 1) I can
play the Alpha when I get a PC (I have a Mac) and 2) there are regular
updates. Not just, "Oh hey guys, here's a wall of text and a pic or two", it's
actual gameplay and something I can interact with.

I think the CEO got overly ambitious but at least it's not No Man's Sky-tier
of fuckedupness.



## Mighty No. 9
📸[Mighty No. 9 on Kickstarter][IMG2]

This game[2], by comcept, is currently the laughing stock of the gaming world
and a cautionary tale for game developers looking to create a Kickstarter for
their game. It was successfully funded on October 1st, 2013. I backed at the
$60 tier for:

- a physical game box (Western/Japanese style)
- printed retro-style game manual (English/Japanese)
- exclusive in-game golden hero (backer-exclusive color variation of Beck,
  the game's hero)

The estimated delivery date for this was April 2015. I just got the physical
rewards a week or two ago. The Nintendo 3DS version? Still waiting for it. I
have a Switch now…



## Sa: The Umbrella Reimagined
📸[The Sa umbrella on Kickstarter][IMG3]

This umbrella[3], by Justin Nagelberg and Matthew Waldman, was successfully
funded on December 1st, 2014. I backed at the $69 tier for:

- one Sa (early limited special)

The estimated delivery date was March 2015. Since being successfully funded,
backers have gotten u̶p̶d̶a̶t̶e̶s̶ essays twice a year about why shipping has
been delayed two years. Basically, because the umbrella is so different that
factories have to be taught how to work on components. Factories is plural
because they've gone through a couple because of shutdowns. Who the hell knows
when I'm gonna get this thing.

- 2017/09/14 update
  - another essay, but with TL;DR version!
  - fully functioning prototype
  - noticed weird things with prototype, fixes for those things is in progress
  - shipping has been pushed back to Winter/Spring 2018

To quote a backer, "Great to see that after nearly 3 years you nearly have a
working prototype".



## The Light Phone
📸[The Light Phone on Kickstarter][IMG4]

This phone[4], by Light, was successfully funded on June 27th, 2015. I backed
at the $25 tier for:

- The Light Book. It documents the process of building the Light Phone and
  includes photos, drawings, and essays. It will cover the entire story from
  ideation to insights into the manufacturing process.

The estimated delivery date was June 2016. I messaged the founders last month
about the book and this was the response:

> Not yet. We would like to include our entire journey of the Light Phone and
> we believe that there is more to come. We will email backers when we plan to
> release the book. Thank you for asking!

I'm not sure how much more of "the journey" needs to be documented but I hope
I get it before the end of 2018.

- 2018/02/28 update
  - creators are launching a new campaign for Light Phone 2, but on
    Indiegogo[5] this time

Here's what they had to say about backers that pledged for the book:

> We have users that pledged for a process book in our original campaign, and
> we want to acknowledge that we have not at all forgotten about you. We've
> continued to document the process and want the book to encompass the Light
> Phone journey in its entirety, through this second generation as well. We
> will offer the book as a pledge in the next campaign as well (a $50
> donation). We have a few ideas for ways to make this even more special for
> those of you who originally donated with a limited edition bonus too.

The end of the Indiegogo campaign is scheduled to end April 2019. The
Kickstarter campaign ended June 2015. I was supposed to get the book
June 2016.



## D̶a̶s̶ ̶K̶e̶y̶b̶o̶a̶r̶d̶ ̶5̶Q̶ GOT IT
📸[Das Keyboard 5Q on Kickstarter][IMG5]

This keyboard[6], by Das Keyboard, was successfully funded on July 30th, 2016.
I backed at the $139 (early bird) tier for:

- one Das Keyboard 5Q for $90 off the $229 retail price.

The estimated delivery date was January 2017. I have a regular Das Keyboard
(Mac version) at home and I love it. What drew me to the 5Q was the ability to
write scripts to mod the keyboard. You can create light shows, make certain
keys change color due to a specified event, and so on. Super customizable!
Anyhoo, people are pissed off because the company makes keyboards for a living
and we *still* don't have ours.

Welp.

- 2017/08/25 update
  - Typhoon Hato damaged a factory in Hong Kong
  - no injuries
  - raw materials and critical production equipment were protected from damage

- 2017/08/31 update
  - 5Q pilot production will begin in a couple days
  - full production schedule for the end of September
  - Kickstarter fulfillment in October, barring any pilot production issues

- 2017/09/25 update
  - solder quality for mechanical switches failed QA
  - incorrect product packaging
  - National Day in China for the first week of October
  - production will start the week of October 30th

- 2018/02/28 update
  - keyboards are shipping!
  - Mac/Linux support is nonexistent…seriously
  - 105-key layout (international) keyboards have damaged switches
  - according to a Superbacker and another backer who got theirs already, the
    keyboard is straight *trash* from the hardware to the software

- 2018/03/13 update
  - I opened a ticket with Das Keyboard's support channel to get the address
    for the 5Q to be changed to one of my best friends. I bought WASD's CODE
    keyboard[7] instead.
  - Roughly 15 months to deliver what appeared to be a lackluster keyboard of
    questionable quality. *Sigh*

With each update, backers become less enthusiastic or get angry. I think it's
safe to say that the Das Keyboard team isn't going to make another crowdfunded
product for a long time, if ever. E̶a̶r̶l̶i̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶s̶u̶m̶m̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶j̶o̶k̶e̶d̶ ̶a̶b̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶g̶e̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g̶

mind that these people are in the business of producing keyboards and have
been doing so since 2005.



## T̶M̶A̶-̶2̶ ̶M̶o̶d̶u̶l̶a̶r̶ ̶H̶e̶a̶d̶p̶h̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶S̶y̶s̶t̶e̶m̶ GOT IT
📸[TMA-2 Modular Headphone System on Kickstarter][IMG6]

This wireless headphone system[8], by AIAIAI, was successfully funded on
December 15th, 2016. I backed at the $65 tier (early bird) for:

- H05 Smart Headband

The estimated delivery date was May 2017. AIAIAI's TMA-2 is a modular
headphone system which means if something on my headphones breaks, I can just
replace a module or two and not the entire thing. I already own the TMA-2 so
what I paid for was the headband to make my headphones wireless. T̶h̶e̶ ̶l̶a̶t̶e̶s̶t̶

I'm tired of using Apple's shitty ear buds and I've gone through two aux
dongles already.

- 2017/08/21 update
  - mass production has been moved to September 11th
  - Kickstarter orders (1436 of 'em) will ship out September 18th - October
    6th
  - I've already confirmed with them that orders will ship in order of
    pledges (I'm backer 46)

- 2017/09/13 update
  - mass production started but minor things needed to change on assembly line
  - 7-10 day delay

- 2017/09/27 update
  - headphones are shipping (̶h̶o̶p̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶u̶p̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶p̶o̶s̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶a̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶p̶l̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶y̶s̶)̶!̶

- 2017/10/18 update
  - I got it! 5 MONTHS LATER



## Indie Microblogging
📸[Indie Microblogging on Kickstarter][IMG7]

This social network and eBook[9], by Manton Reece, was successfully funded on
February 1st, 2017. I backed at the $10 tier for:

- PDF and ePub versions of the book, plus early access to Micro.blog

These are some of the book topics:

- how to adapt blogging tools like WordPress and Tumblr to work with
  microblogs.
- the important role of cross-posting to Twitter, and the best tools out
  there.
- tips for integrating a microblog into an existing weblog.
- architecture for microblogs, with a behind-the-scenes look at how Micro.blog
  was built.
- overview of the latest IndieWebCamp and W3C proposals for indie
  microblogging, such as Webmention and Micropub.
- Manton's personal stories on why it matters so much to preserve content on
  the Internet.

The estimated delivery date was March 2017. Like Star Citizen, I'm not sore
about my eBook reward being delayed. Manton is creating an entire social
network by himself and managing a Slack group for backers. I haven't setup
this blog with micro.blog yet either so it looks like we're both delayed,
haha! He's actively working on finishing the book though.



## J̶a̶c̶k̶:̶ ̶M̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶A̶n̶y̶ ̶H̶e̶a̶d̶p̶h̶o̶n̶e̶s̶ ̶W̶i̶r̶e̶l̶e̶s̶s̶ GOT IT
📸[Jack on Kickstarter][IMG8]

This Jack adapter[10], by Podo Labs, was successfully funded on February
25th, 2017. I backed at the $25 (early bird) tier for:

- one Jack adapter

The estimated delivery date was June 2017. The latest update promises that
I'll get this by the end of October at the latest. You might be wondering why
I backed two Kickstarters that are headphone-focused. I like music and I'm
beginning to despise wires. Should the battery on my H05 run out, I can attach
a cable to it and that cable to the Jack. I'll have to stuff the cord in my
bag or someplace but it'll still be wireless!

- 2017/10/06 update
  - Delays of course, but the team makes it seem as though they were
    blindsided by a Chinese holiday. This isn't their first KS and from the
    comments, they have a history of making promises they can't keep, having
    tons of delays, and announcing new projects before the current one is
    fulfilled.
  - "Production" unit shown doesn't match prototype, and while understandable
    to a degree it's disappointing.

- 2019 May update
  - This was sent to my old address so it took a couple weeks to get to me.
    Eighteen friggin' months for this thing? SMH. They even had the nerve to
    advertise new Kickstarter campaigns while I waited.



## S̶t̶e̶a̶d̶i̶c̶a̶m̶ ̶V̶o̶l̶t̶ GOT IT
📸[Steadicam Volt on Kickstarter][IMG9]

This smartphone stabilizer[11], by The Tiffen Company, was successfully funded
on March 5th, 2017. I backed at the $139 (early bird) tier for:

- Steadicam Volt for $60 off the planned $199 retail price

This includes:

- Steadicam Volt Stabilizer
- 5x magnetic and 1x starter balance weight
- 2x batteries
- battery charger
- Micro-USB cable
- quickstart guide
- carrying pouch

The estimated delivery date was June 2017. Because retailers like B&H received
Steadicam Volts before backers, we all get a premium carrying case for free.
Not bad, but I expected to get the Volt before this month so I could get
awesome beach footage of my kids. It's now the middle of August so that plan
was ruined. When companies show prototypes that are *super* close to the
finished product and show they have years of experience doing things, and
yadda x3, I expect to get rewards in a relatively short timeframe. Like the
Das Keyboard, this is not the case here. Apparently, shipping is supposed to
start this month.

- 2017/09/08 update
  - shipping warehouse is overbooked
  - shipping will start on the 11th
  - everyone should get tracking information shortly

- 2017/09/14 update
  - I don't have tracking info

- 2017/09/21 update
  - I got it! THREE MONTHS LATER



## B̶l̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶I̶n̶k̶ WOMP
📸[Black Ink on Kickstarter[IMG10]

This film[12], by Craig Rippon, was successfully funded on April 21st, 2017.
I backed at the $25 tier for:

- Black Heroes Matter t-shirt

This includes:

- movie ticket code for advance online screening
- my name listed in the "Thank You" section of the film
- link to the 2nd trailer for the film when it's completed
- BLACK INK computer wallpaper

The estimated delivery date was May 2017 (for the t-shirt, not the film) and
Craig has been unresponsive.

- 2017/10/11 update
  - Craig has been dealing with a LOT of family health issues, one of which is
    serious.
  - The company he was working with to get the books didn't honor the apparent
    discount agreement they had. Maybe time ran out for that?
  - The film *should* be out in February.

- 2019 May update
  - I don't care anymore.

I was a bit miffed when I didn't hear anything for months but not anymore,
Craig can take all the time he needs.



## Honorable mention
With the exception of Star Citizen and Indie Microblogging (and as of October
11th, Black Ink), all this has been rather annoying. Honorable mention goes
out to Massdrop for the MiTo Canvas XDA Custom Keycap Set[13] I've yet to
receive. The drop completed on February 1st, 2017. I paid $72.97 (shipping
included) for the Bauhaus Icon Modifiers and Betas. This is what it'll look
like:

📸[MiTo Canvas XDA Custom Keycap Set on Massdrop][IMG11]

The estimated ship date was June 2nd, 2017 and the new one is now October.
*Kanye shrug* I plan on putting these awesome keys on my existing Das
Keyboard…I just noticed I'll need to purchase additional keys for my number
pad.



## Conclusion
The moral of this story? It used to be that you could pledge for something on
Kickstarter and expect to get the product on or damn close to the promised
delivery date. I love the idea of supporting promising businesses but I think
I'll just wait until whatever product is available on Amazon before parting
with my money. Who wants to be constantly let down all the time? Not me, not
anymore. 🕸
