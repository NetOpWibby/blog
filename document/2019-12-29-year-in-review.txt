In my last "Year in Review" post I stated that Socii would have photo
functionality. It doesâ€¦it just isn't reliable, haha. I haven't cracked that
bit quite yet and I've also been spending time on getting other projects up to
speed. Anyhoo, let's dig into what has happened this year!



## Visited Disney World

My wife and I never had the opportunity to visit when we were kids so we
decided to treat our own kids to a family trip there. My son threw my phone
into a shallow pool and I heard it hit the bottomâ€¦that's when I knew enough
water had gotten in. Sure enough, my phone was out of commission for almost
the entire trip. Luckily there are Apple Stores everywhere so I got a
replacement during some downtime.

The lockscreen background[1] on my phone is *still* an amazing shot I got
of the EPCOT ball at night.

In addition, the entire family got sunburnt. I had it the *worst* since I
wasn't wearing a shirt at the beach. It was an interesting experience, one
that I'd rather not repeat. Melanin-enriched or not, sunscreen is good
for you.

## Went bald ðŸ˜±

I grow facial hair quite easily but on *top* of my head? Umm, let's just say
it doesn't fill out like it used to. I blame the stresses of my 20s. And
possibly wearing hats a lot. Anyhoo, I was always scared to do so because I
wasn't sure how my head would look. Turned out great!

Also, my son had his first (barbershop) haircut! He took it a lot better than
we expected.

## Attended Comic-Con

I've been to PAX East a couple times so I was excited to finally check out
Comic-Con andâ€¦it's not my thing. I like comic books but not as much as I like
video games. Still, it was a good experience. Also, since my trip to Japan in
2017 I have been *craving* a wonderful drink called Mitsuya Cider[2]. One of
my best buddies and I trekked to at least *three* different Japanese shops in
New York City before stopping for ramen. While in the restaurant I asked the
owner if he knew where we could find some and he gave us directions to a
strange market with an elevator. Sure enough, the drink was there!

I don't do checked baggage when I'm on short trips so I had to guzzle all
three bottles I purchased in the remaining amount of time I had in the city.



## Warmed up to an abandoned kitten

My daughter came home from her bus stop one day cradling a kitten we later
learned was roughly a week or two old. It was also wet and cold outside so she
and a classmate each took a kitten home. My wife did most of the work of
nursing "Chi Chi" back to health and then put her up for adoption after a few
weeks. Sadly, we just don't have the space for a pet at the moment and our
daughter wasn't pulling her weight in taking care of the kitten she brought
home. Fortunately, Chi Chi grew into a gorgeous lil' cat and was promptly
adopted. Turns out, she was quite popular amongst families visiting the animal
shelter so I'm glad she'll have the space and care she needs to explore
and grow.

When we move into a bigger place I definitely want to get a similar-looking
cat. After I get my Dalmatian.

## Made it "big" on Hacker News

I love checking out Hacker News (HN)[3] as I find all sorts of neat projects
and learn of interesting articles through it. I've been checking out
Lobsters[4] lately too (and got an invite as I drafted what you're reading).

I shared my recent post[5] about a "personal API" there and to my pleasant
surprise it was well-received[6] (with 156 points)! The post inspired some
people to check out my other online webpages and projects and even encouraged
some signups for Socii, to my horror (it's not ready for prime-time). I've
also received requests for collaboration so that should be interesting.

The other feedback I got from HN was *intense* negativity about the horizontal
scrolling so I quickly created a toggle to disable it. Apparently, Windows
users have a horrible experience with it. Coming from a macOS background and
with huge trackpads, horizontal scrolling is actually quite pleasant for me so
I never did further testing when I initially implemented it. ðŸ˜¬

As I proofread the post you're reading, reception[7] on Lobsters is quite good
too. I spend more time coding than I do writing but when I *do* write I get
more ideas and knowledge due to feedback. Note to future Paul: keep doing this
writing thing!



## Started learning TypeScript

TypeScript[8] is a layer on top of JavaScript that basically helps prevent you
from making mistakes in your code, which helps create more robust
applications. Initially I decided to learn Flow so I could incrementally add
static types to a small API project but after an interview I decided to jump
right into TypeScript. Man, I wish I did so earlier instead of mucking around
in Flow. I'm still no expert but I'm having fun with it and I found egregious
code patterns in existing projects thanks to TypeScript.



## Released a couple projects

- `chronver.org`[9]: A date-based versioning specification that makes more
  sense to me these days than SemVer.
- `lefty.world`[10]: A fun site for left-handed people. I intend to do more
  with this in 2020.
- `webb.page`[11]: My new homepage and probably the best domain I own.



## FIN

As is customary, here are some of my favorite pics I snapped this year. ðŸ•¸
