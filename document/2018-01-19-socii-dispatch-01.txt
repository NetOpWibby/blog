tldr:  Updates with Socii's development
---

For the past month I've been hard at work, developing basic social network
features. Namely, account and post creation and editing your profile. To be
honest, it's not glamorous work but I've been having a blast doing it. Here's
what's been completed thus far.



## Profile
ðŸ“¸[First look at your profile][IMG1]

On your profile, you'll see your avatar in whatever shape you choose from
available options which are a triangle (the default), circle (classic), square
(old-school), diamond, and inverted triangle. Below your avatar in the first
sidebar, you'll find your name and username.

When you sign up for Socii, you're automatically logged in and given a
generated username based on your email address so feel free to change it if
something like `paul927465` doesn't quite fit you. Anecdotally, I've noticed
that as people go through life changes they tend to want user/name changes as
well so I've made Socii unreliant on usernames on the back-end. Friends and
followers would want to know if you go from `SuperAwesomeMegaTon` to
`netop://~tonton` and I'm building a notification system to accommodate that.

There are currently no limits on username changes and I can conceivably see
how harassment could occur with it. You'll be equipped with proper muting and
blocking tools should you unwittingly connect with an annoying person.

In the other sidebar, you'll see something called "top 8". Older readers will
remember the *glory* that was MySpace and I wanted to bring that back as I
found it useful.

Sometimes I just want to visit a friend's page and I forget what their
username is (and, if you follow a lot of people who post more often than your
friend(s), you'll miss their posts). I sure know what my friends *look* like
though and it'll be pretty sweet to see which shapes they choose for their
avatars.

And of course you'll find your personal stream of posts. Within each post
block is a menu indicator that contains actions for editing your post, quick
copying of the direct link to the post, pinning the post to your profile, and
deleting the post. If you want to like your own post for some reason, you can
definitely do that. You can also create threads by responding to your own
posts.



## Post creation

Socii supports Markdown! I'm using a customized version of Showdown[1] to
enable it. The eye icon in the footer of the post creator allows for
previewing what your post will look like when it's live. The character limit
is 150 for reasons that will become apparent in a couple months, after I ship
a major (secret) feature.

However, your post can be up to *5,000 characters* long if you so choose! ðŸ˜°
That'd be *extremely* annoying to attempt scrolling in a feed so posts longer
than 150 characters will be truncated by default with a button to expand it
should anyone want to read the entire thing. The question mark icon will give
you quick tips on how to use Markdown to add a bit of flavor to your posts.

If you'd like to read a long post but don't have time at the moment, you can
save that post for future reading.

For the moment, only one post status type is available and that is "publish".
Forthcoming updates will bring three more: drafts, queues, and schedule.
Similarly, the only post creator mode available is "text" but future updates
will bring photo, audio, and video options.



## In progress
There's still a good amount of work to get done. For starters, there's no way
for you to change your avatar and that's the *first* thing I do when joining a
new service. I also want to get notifications and the global/top 8 feeds
working. I think being able to toggle between what everyone is talking about
versus whomever in your top 8 is talking about will be neat.

I want to be more open about developing Socii for a couple reasons:

1. I want this social network to be good for people.
2. I develop in a vacuum and while I share updates with a couple people IRL, I
   think other people could benefit from what I'm learning in the process.
3. External reminder of what I have accomplished. Most people can agree that
   we accomplish things but beat ourselves up for that *one* thing we didn't
   do. That's demoralizing and I don't want to stop before Socii gets into
   people's hands.

With that said, I'm making a new commitment to releasing Socii at the end of
this month for alpha access to members of my mailing list. If you haven't
joined yet, you can find it at socii.network[2]. For more information about
Socii, you can read this post[3] or check out the manifesto on Socii's
official marketing page.



## Things I've learned
I figured it'd be a good idea to share what I've learned since my last blog
post about Socii:

1. I'm tired of rounded corners everywhere. I've removed `border-radius` from
   all the Sass files.
2. GraphQL is awesome. However, I've been building REST APIs for the past
   month and have two microservices to handle things thus far and that means
   I'm not transitioning to GraphQL until maybe version 1 of Socii is
   solidified. ðŸ˜¤ Wish I learned of it sooner (it's basically a better way to
   do REST and talk to servers).
3. Styling with `:root`. This[4] is how everyone will have customized profile
   pages. I don't know why every example I've seen it used has root styles
   overriding each other. I try to write my CSS in a way that doesn't have
   style overrides because it's a hassle to deal with. If you have
   `:root.user` styling, just have `:root:not(.user)` for your default
   styling. Easy.

That's all for now, see ya! ðŸ•¸
