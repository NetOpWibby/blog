So much has happened this year, not just for me but my wife as well. Let's dig
in.



## I quit Instagram
A year prior I quit Facebook proper but it seemed disingenuous to continue
using Instagram. Knowing that I was still in FB Land made me feel gross so my
last post was New Years Day.



## Attained Wakandan Citizenship
Black Panther was the greatest movie of the year. I want Kimoyo Beads[1]
*badly*.



## Moved to Tennessee
Family friends invited us to stay with them while 1) I found a new job and 2)
we found a home of our own. I *would not* recommend this as it was stressful in
several annoying ways but it was only four months. Lessons learned?

- Trust your gut (in hindsight, I should have seen my layoff coming)
- Have a savings fund



## Got more serious about projects
Socii[2] saw improvements, Chew[3] was launched, and I released some
open-source[4] modules[5] and[6] configs[7] on npm.

Along the way, I discovered better "good practices" and I'm keen on improving
them further in the new year.

Oh, and I transitioned from GitLab to Gitea[8]. GitLab is a resource hog and
reminds of old Wordpress. I am much happier with Gitea and it is customizable!
I haven't done any customization though, haha.

My wife delved into sewing more, improved her skills tenfold, and is becoming
known in the sewing community. I now have intermediate knowledge about cover
stiches and what stiches look like when using 1-3 needles.



## Bought more indie music
Stream life is just not for me, at least music-wise. Tidal, Spotify,
Apple Musicâ€¦none of it sticks with me. I've found myself using Bandcamp a lot
more this year and I mean a LOT.

Some awesome musicians I've discovered are LAKIM[9], ãƒžã‚¯ãƒ­ã‚¹MACROSS 82-99[10],
Eric Lau[11], Dent May[12], The PLAYlist[13], leon chang[14], YUNG BAE[15]â€¦I
could keep going but that small list should keep your ears busy for a couple
hours.



## FIN
For the past couple years I've ended my annual review posts with my top nine
popular Instagram posts but since I don't use that platform anymoreâ€¦here are
some favorited images from my phone.

This time next year, Socii will have photo functionality. ðŸ•¸
