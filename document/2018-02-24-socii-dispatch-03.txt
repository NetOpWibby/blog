I have been cranking out features and improvements over the past month. As I
gear up for a major feature release, I'd like to quickly run through what's in
production now and what I've learned since my last dispatch.



## Top 8
From the ashes of Myspace comes a feature I've missed dearly in every social
network since. Why is this important to me? Well, sometimes I forget my
friends' usernames. I never forget a face. With Socii you can change your
username whenever you want so for people you *really* want to keep in contact
with (outside of real-life phone numbers and such), adding them to your top 8
is the way to go.

ðŸ“¸[ðŸŽ¶ I'm bringing Myspace back, yeah!][IMG1]



## Performance
Three notable changes fall under this section.

First, I got rid of the WebP decoder[1] (and fixed an issue that arose on
account of me doing too much in one commit). It was a bit slow in development
which should have made me realize it'd be MUCH too slow for production (even
the WebAssembly-based/-compiled decoder I found wasn't good enough).
Blink-based browsers (Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, &c) were unaffected but Firefox
and Safari suffered *greatly*. Personally, I use Firefox as my main browser so
I felt this pain and *hated* it.

ðŸ“¸[Bye bye WebPâ€¦for now][IMG2]

Second, I implemented pagination. Prior to this, the hub (homepage of the
actual network[2], not the marketing site[3]) was loading every. Single. Post.
It was a friggin' *mess* tbh. Now, I'd like to have done this in my GraphQL
service but I don't understand enough about it to implement cursor-based
paging so the solution I came up with is kinda hacky. It works *for now* but
I'm on the lookout for tutorials or code samples that implement *proper*
GraphQL pagination with `graphql.js` (even the official "how to[4])" site is
devoid of this information).

Finally, I created a custom script bundler to minify and combine front-end
JavaScript so there would be far less render-blocking scripts to deal with.
All the bundling frameworks like Rollup, Webpack, &c, do too much while also
not being flexible enough to do what I wanted to do.

I'm still working on improving performance. No one wants to visit a sluggish
site, it's a waste of your time.



## Timelines
You can now toggle between the global timeline and your top 8 timeline (well,
if you've *added* anyone to that list).



## Responsiveness
As a front-end designer, it hurt me to publish something that didn't work well
at smaller browser widths/breakpoints. I was *finally* able to get a *lot* of
the stylistic things that were bothering me taken care of. Looking at these
screenshots though, I gotta rethink the post footer. It looks too fat, I think
both bits of info can fit on the same line.

ðŸ“¸[Ooh, dat sweet responsive network][IMG3]



## Things I've learned
1. Ship small features often. Not only do you get a sense of progression, but
   you can find issues quickly should you accidentally push errors into
   production.
2. Image uploading iÌ¶nÌ¶ Ì¶aÌ¶ Ì¶pÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶fÌ¶oÌ¶rÌ¶mÌ¶aÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶[Ì¶5Ì¶]Ì¶ Ì¶wÌ¶aÌ¶yÌ¶ that performs well with WebSockets
   is harder than I thought. I *think* I have something figured out but I have
   some non-Socii work to catch up on before I test my theory.



That's all for now, see ya! ðŸ•¸
