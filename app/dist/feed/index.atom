        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You are the operating system]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>Shortly after <a href="/2019/future-of-the-operating-system-revisited-i" title="The Future of the Operating System: Revisited, Part 1">revisiting</a> my thoughts about the future of operating systems I was pestered with a recurring thought; what if one had a personal API sitting on a $5/month VPS (virtual private server) and interfaced with it for nearly everything they do online? It wasn&#39;t far-fetched for me to then imagine this personal API becoming more of a personal OS in a way (or maybe stylized, personalOS). With that in mind I realized that when thinking about updating <a href="https://webb.page" title="My web page is Webb.Page! Hehehe">my personal web page</a> I didn&#39;t want to update the content manually. Rather, I&#39;d want to update an API and have my site(s) automatically update. <strong>Oh yeah</strong>, why <em>not</em> have multiple sites update?</p>
<p>A personal API would make it easy for people to decentralize parts of their digital lives. There are companies built upon the concept of decentralization and that&#39;s promising. A rising tide raises all ships, as they say, and I can see a day where non-technical people are spinning up servers as much as they&#39;re migrating data to a new smartphone (well, if they did all this via a nice UI).</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s a use case: I&#39;m signed up to several social networks, forums, and I have a couple websites. I&#39;m a digital tastemaker and pride myself on being current and relevant. However, updating my account bio across these platforms is a 20-minute task that I dread doing. Never fear for my API has a biography module! Realistically, all the platforms I frequent won&#39;t have an API I can connect my own to, but a handful will. My personal API sends out update requests to the platforms it is connected to and updates my bio section when I publish the relevant changes to my API.</p>
<p>That example may be a little contrived so let&#39;s try another one: I&#39;m a developer who prefers to self-host things whenever possible. I am also quite lazy and live by DRY (don&#39;t repeat yourself) and KISS (keep it simple, silly) principles to the extent I can without much difficulty. I&#39;m also fatigued and distrustful of the capability of online services in general to keep my data safe. If I trust nothing else I at least trust myself and a code base I can peruse.</p>
<h2 id="version-alpha">Version Alpha</h2>
<p><em>Please keep in mind that this is still a super early idea and the purpose of this post is to get the particulars fleshed out.</em></p>
<p>What follows is my proposed folder structure of the personal API. Modules come in two types: purpose and utility. Utility modules allow the purpose modules to do their thing, like retrieving/modifying/storing data (on DigitalOcean&#39;s Spaces, Amazon&#39;s S3, or your own storage location). Ideally you should never have to touch those modules unless you wanted to improve upon it or fork your own version. Purpose modules can be anything you think of and the examples I listed could be your personal Medium, Pinboard/Pinterest, Things, Spotify, Flickr/Instagram, Last.fm, and so on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">api
├─ …
├─ modules
│  ├─ purpose
│  │  ├─ blog
│  │  ├─ bookmarks
│  │  ├─ music
│  │  ├─ photos
│  │  ├─ portfolio
│  │  ├─ reminders
│  │  ├─ scrobbler
│  │  └─ status
│  └─ utility
│     ├─ database
│     └─ storage
└─ …</code></pre>
<p>The purpose functions would be able to call the utility functions to, well, function. <code>webb.page</code> will be the guinea pig for the initial release of personalOS. Once it works there I will update parts of <code>inc.sh</code> and <code>dsgn.agency</code> to take advantage of it as well.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why Bother?</h2>
<p>You, dear reader, are probably not terribly interested in self-hosting and dev ops. Even developers/engineers who know <em>how</em> to do it aren&#39;t interested. Some of the common reasons against self-hosting are fear (of the work involved), apathy (&quot;my data isn&#39;t super important anyway&quot;), time (the only valid reason IMHO), or a combination of the three. While I understand I also think <strong>it is incredibly important to claim your space on the Internet</strong>. We&#39;re all <a href="https://info.ideagrove.com/knowledgebase/digital-marketing/what-is-digital-sharecropping-and-why-is-it-a-bad-thing" title="What is &#39;digital sharecropping&#39; and why is it a bad thing?">digital sharecroppers</a> so why not tend to <em>our own space on the &#39;Net</em>?</p>
<p>It&#39;s a helluva lot easier to monetize your content when it lives on your platform, or personalOS in this case. Monetization doesn&#39;t have to be your focus though. How about this: something that irritates me about Apple&#39;s Music app and iOS 13 is that I have no idea how to get my music that used to live in iTunes, onto my phone anymore. Once I build a music module for personalOS I can upload my music library to my own server and stream it on the go. The major streaming services are great and all but my music collection has rips from video game soundtracks, anime, and otherwise defunct groups with no content on these streaming services. Why would I give that up? Why <strong>should</strong> I?!</p>
<h2 id="business-opportunity">Business Opportunity?</h2>
<p>Y&#39;know what would be nice? Having an easy way to share any files that you&#39;re hosting. Although, you may not want to expose your personal API server to the public. For this purpose, you could use a third-party site like <code>personal.sh</code> to generate shareable links (probably via <code>personal.sh/are</code>, I&#39;m a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack" title="Explanation of &#39;Domain hack&#39; on Wikipedia">domain hacking</a>).</p>
<p>Because the Internet is open to all, there will inevitably be disturbing/disgusting/morally-bankrupt content shared through <code>personal.sh</code>. If/when that happens, the offending user will have their IP address blacklisted and put on display at <code>personal.sh/it</code>. It&#39;s no secret that anonymity gives some people courage to behave in a way that&#39;s unbecoming.</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h2>
<p>There&#39;s a company named Urbit who&#39;s mission is quite similar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Urbit is a networked personal server that runs your apps and stores your data, serves as your permanent online identity and puts you back in control of your digital life under a single login.</p>
<p>When you’re ready.<br/>— <a href="https://twitter.com/urbitlive/status/1192262246384230400" title="&#39;urbit live&#39; account on Twitter">urbit live</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only problem is, their official site makes their mission <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21672481">quite</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18908051">confusing</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6438320">to many</a>. I don&#39;t know about you but if I&#39;m entrusting my data to something I run, I want to have more than a <em>general idea</em> of how it works.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT (2019.12.05):</strong> This post has generated lively discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21684949">HackerNews</a> and as a result we now have more examples of prior art!</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there exists portions of the personalOS concept of various development maturation levels. To me, this is proof of the worthwhile nature of this idea. Will this likely end up sitting in a repo for years after months of initial work? Probably. Hopefully not...we&#39;ll see how it goes. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Startups are hard, respect is easy]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h3>
<p>I got my start in the web/tech space over a decade ago, during the economic recession of 2008.</p>
<p>Two years prior I was in college for a couple months until Johnson &amp; Wales&#39; campus police called to let me know I&#39;d need to leave by the end of the week. Unbeknownst to me the college fund that was <em>allegedly</em> prepared for me never existed (!!) and the funny thing about bounced checks is, <em>no one likes them</em>; especially an institution that needs to pay its faculty. Anyhoo, in 2008 I was tasked with &quot;getting myself back into school&quot; <em>somehow</em> and was sent to the next town over from JWU to start.</p>
<p>My landlord, a portly self-deprecating guy with a glass eye and a heart of friggin&#39; <em>gold</em>, allowed me stay rent free as long as I kept him up to date with my job search progress. In my downtime I perused online communities like deviantART and Pixelfuckers (defunct) and attempted to emulate what I saw in the awesome desktop modding scene. That led to attempting vector art and boy, this was frustrating as hell to learn. Photoshop&#39;s pen tool just did not make sense at <em>all</em> and Illustrator was too strange. One day...it clicked. I could do it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nokadota/art/2nd-Vector-72286668"><img src="/assets/images/2019/a-decade-in-tech-a.png" alt="2nd Vector"/></a></p>
<p>Yes, revel in this <em>monstrosity</em>. Admire it. <strong>Fear</strong> it (the <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nokadota/art/Above-The-Clouds-71695497">later version</a> of this looks <em>way</em> better).</p>
<p>At some point I was designing so <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nokadota/gallery">much</a> that I decided I needed a website, naturally. I mocked something in Photoshop and emailed a PSD to HTML service to see how much it would cost to convert my &quot;super awesome&quot; design to a website and I was quoted either $100 or $500. Whichever amount it was, I was <em>incensed</em>. Furious, even. Couldn&#39;t they see I was trying to start something? Why would they charge me so much? The au<em>dacity</em> of these people!</p>
<p>In my anger, I learned how to code my first website[1].</p>
<p>Yes. I was petulant and figured it out because I was misguided in my anger at someone/some people trying to run a business in a recession. It sounds quite silly in hindsight but, there you have it.</p>
<p>At that point I also understood that web design and development is not something easily done <em>correctly</em>. Doesn&#39;t it make sense why someone would charge to do it for you? Armed with this newfound knowledge I dove into the Internet head first and scoured it for web development tips. Often, these tips came from horribly designed websites 🥴. Indeed there was a time before Envato and their Tuts+ tutorial sites burst onto the scene.</p>
<h3 id="i-made-it">I Made It</h3>
<p>Sometime in 2012 I was working retail and applying for web design/development roles I was <strong>definitely</strong> not suited for but YOLO (pretty sure YOLO wasn&#39;t said then but y&#39;know, same energy)! Just fire and forget, leave for work, come back home and check email. One day I got a response back from <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, a design/development agency in Downtown Crossing (Boston)! One of the co-founders wanted me to come in and interview for their apprenticeship program. Elated, I made the trek downtown with my heavy laptop and couldn&#39;t wait to show off my work.</p>
<p>My elation disappated when <a href="https://chad.is">Chad Mazolla</a> said (paraphrasing, too long ago):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your code is terrible...but your design is good. Great, even! We need more stuff like this on the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that, I was in! The program lasted a few short months and while I was the only one who wasn&#39;t offered a job through thoughtbot or their partner companies afterward, I will say that it was the best experience I could have had at that point in my life. If nothing else, I finally had something I could put on my non-retail resume!</p>
<p>Over the next couple years I would go on to do contract jobs and later work for startup after startup after startup. I&#39;ve worked for a &quot;regular&quot; company here and there but end up going back to startups. Even though they come with uncertainty[2], they are often working on challenging ideas and projects that can change some aspect of the world in interesting ways. I&#39;m drawn to that. I also love learning how to do things I either don&#39;t feel like learning on my own time or never thought about learning. <strong>The best teacher is experience so why not <em>get paid</em> to do it?</strong> This allows you to initiate ambitious side projects solo instead of waiting/relying on someone else to get an MVP running.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important than the technical skills acquired, I learned how <em>not</em> to treat people. Sometimes this was an <a href="https://2016.dsgn.io/thoughts/post/the-importance-of-process">analysis</a> of <em>my own behavior</em> but more often than not the actions of <em>leadership</em> exemplified this.</p>
<h3 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h3>
<p>The following scenarios are situations I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You&#39;re an apprentice and a developer mentoring someone else in the program regularly talks over you and pumps up his apprentice whenever he can. Maybe his disdain for you is because you&#39;re self-taught or was personally invited by the co-CEO to join the program. Or maybe the developer didn&#39;t like you having regular conversation with the (female) office manager. You&#39;re new, you just want to absorb information from everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>You learn many years later that this same developer also treated prospective clients quite rudely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>CEO picks his nose and makes eye contact with you. This happens enough that you learn how to have a blind spot whenever you turn your head and see him in your peripheral vision.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a contractor, you end up doing the job of the guy you&#39;re reporting under while he browses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystiq">Joystiq</a> for gaming news. You are later fired and realize he threw you under the bus for his work not getting done. <strong>Many</strong> years later you see him in a Target department store and after recognizing you he discovers a sudden interest in ceiling architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you&#39;re dealing with the excrutiating sorrow of miscarriage, the CEO puts you on a dubious &quot;project&quot; for his father&#39;s company. A week or two later you&#39;re in a firing meeting, sans CEO. In the minutes following the firing you look around for the CEO to have a conversation with him but he&#39;s nowhere to be found, even though you just saw him five minutes prior.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CEO constantly lies to you and your coworkers about the health of the company and surprises y&#39;all a week or so from Christmas <em>on pay day</em> with &quot;Hey, sorry, we can&#39;t pay you&quot; phone call. Money eventually shows up but this happens at least once more before the company folds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CEO loves your work and mindset and tasks you with unleashing your creativity on core properties. Then come caveats. You create something cool, you guess, with caveats because core users would be &quot;confused&quot; by drastic changes. A month or so later, CEO okays a developer <em>not</em> hired for their design sensibilities to drastically redesign the core product. CEO reiterates your importance while restricting your expression.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You notice there&#39;s someone on the platform you are helping develop who has advocated for harm and negative energy towards people who share your creed/likeness/ethnicity. You get on a call with the CEO and he not only downplays the matter but he disregards how you feel about it. He also claims organizations like <a href="https://www.splcenter.org">SPLC</a> are disengenous and blow things out of proportion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios are situations I&#39;ve witnessed and/or stepped in to defend/protect.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Designers wrack their brains over new features and present to UX lead for her expert opinion. Idea gets shut down due to claim by lead over &quot;impossible&quot;[3] claims.</p>
<ul>
<li>I walk by and overhear the designers speaking amongst themselves, bummed about yet another idea that <em>seems</em> feasible but apparently &quot;isn&#39;t&quot;.</li>
<li>I create a branch and implement their idea in ~10 minutes. Designers are happy, UX lead is not.</li>
<li>To be clear, this doesn&#39;t add extra work for anyone but me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Back-end engineers who want something done on the front-end approach UX lead. &quot;Too much work&quot;, &quot;not worth it&quot;, &quot;impossible&quot;, and so on is claimed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m present during this conversation and rattle off similar experiences I&#39;ve had in my personal projects that relate.</li>
<li>Developers are happy, UX lead is not.</li>
<li>No extra work for anyone but me and it&#39;s not an obscene amount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>At an annual all-hands event, CTO speaks about how he learned the importance of listening from a leadership course he&#39;s been taking. 10 minutes later, CEO blames entire company (and himself but not really) for our lack of innovation leading to the then-(still?)negative status of the company while the CTO stares at the ground in deep thought.</p>
<ul>
<li>A developer protests accusation and mentions several instances where he tried to provide input, only to be shut down by CEO.</li>
<li>Conversation turns into a shouting match.</li>
<li>Other developers jump in to co-sign the initial protest.</li>
<li>You later learn that some developers at the company ignore the CEO and pursue things <em>they</em> know they need to work on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Marketing team repeatedly express frustration with lack of non-developer-friendly tooling for things like updating the company blog, sending email blasts, and so on. CEO is a technical developer and regularly dismisses them, starting sentences with things like &quot;It&#39;s so easy&quot; and &quot;All you have to do is...c&#39;mon, it&#39;s not so bad.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t have much to do so I offer to improve some aspects of their job. After initial pushback I&#39;m begrungingly allowed to do so.</li>
<li>Two days later, I&#39;m tasked with going about this process with caveats (and throwing away substantial work in the process).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>CEO has something negative to say about anyone who quits. &quot;He wasn&#39;t that great anyway&quot; and things like that, often on conference calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all the scenarios I could list off the top of my head. I&#39;m a positive person by nature so this was an uncomfortable walk down Memory Lane.</p>
<p>For people in the web/tech space, the aforementioned scenarios are quite common. Heck, I&#39;m quite sure they echo what happened <em>today</em> somewhere...and you witnessed it. A common thread that links the leadership mentioned (aside from the CTO) is apathy; a complete lack of empathy, social understanding/awareness, or just <em>care</em>. In the comment about my self analysis earlier, I linked a blog post where I realized I put my ego before the team I was hired to work with. I was, quite frankly, a jackass[4] and there&#39;s no room for one unless you work at a zoo. Self-reflection is a useful tool you should pull out every now and then and as you can probably tell, most people don&#39;t utilize it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t build your dream, someone will hire you to help build theirs.<br/>— Tony Gaskin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reflect upon this quote often as I help people build their dreams (startups) while also building <a href="https://socii.network">my own</a>. I do believe there&#39;s been a sea change in the industry around employee happiness and retention. Have a look at job postings and you will see work satisfaction and happiness as a perk.</p>
<p>No one wants to work in a hostile environment and after a while, people realize they don&#39;t have to put up with bullshit and they quit (or are fired before they get the chance, lol). To echo the tone of Gaskin&#39;s quote but modified for business leadership:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to build your dream, hire the best people and treat them like family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming you have a great family or a close cadre of friends you regard as family, would you treat them like the aforementioned leaders have? Probably not. It&#39;s really not that difficult to be a decent person.</p>
<p>One of my closest friends is in a coding bootcamp and shares his works in progress with me and another close friend on a regular basis. I&#39;m the most technical of us but what sense would it make for me to downplay his efforts? What would I gain from that? It&#39;s my responsibility to assist in his professional development because I have the means to and I consider him family.</p>
<p>A decade is a long time and software and startups come and go. Even people do. Memories, do not (I mean, aside from cognitive disorders).</p>
<p>You remember the developer that treated me like shit during my apprenticeship? His name came up in an interview I had two years ago via my interviewer, half a decade later! Therefore, it is <em>imperitive</em> that you treat people how you would like to be treated, your reputation could precede you whether it&#39;s positive or not.</p>
<p>No matter what life-changing product you embark on or assist with creating, you will get there a helluva lot faster surrounded by people who respect you and vice-versa. If you&#39;ve forgotten about the Golden Rule, here&#39;s a handy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">refresher</a>. 🕸</p>

<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>My first domain name was <code>pw-software.com</code> (it now redirects to <code>webb.page</code>). Back in the early 2010s, I blogged about design and redesigned my site at least three times a year. It was the <em>hottest</em> of messes. Back then I used Google and regularly searched for &quot;PW Software&quot; to check my search ranking. For a while, a company called &quot;P+W Software&quot; was the first result. The constant linking of my website to Facebook and deviantART improved SEO so much that I soon took the number one spot. P+W Software was later <a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/press-release/consumer-health-technologies-inc-acquires-pw-software">acquired</a> by another company. When ICANN released the <code>.page</code> TLD I was absolutely <strong>required</strong> to obtain what&#39;s probably the nicest domain on the planet and make it my new default home on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All but two startups I&#39;ve worked for no longer exist. The first one was acquired but I was seasonal help and thus was too far gone to delight in their success. The second one seems like it&#39;s not doing too well behind the scenes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A word I hate more than almost anything (the taste of asparagus will be difficult to unseat) is &quot;impossible&quot; and to hear professionals in the web/tech space use this word so casually is <strong>frustrating</strong>. We literally have supercomputers in our pockets to share <em>memes</em> but it&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; to make text with a drop shadow expand across the screen before flipping into an explosion of color with emoji rain. <strong>Impossible is not a word, it&#39;s an excuse.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>I really wanted to underscore how much of a jackass I was prior to that post being published but was advised against it by leadership. This most likely had something to do with editorial voice of the company but few words exist to exemplify negative behavior with such conciseness.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The previous version of Socii consisted of seven &quot;microservices&quot; and two web apps that were eventually condensed to two APIs and (hopefully) a sensible stack. This post will detail the process and why the changes were made.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Old Socii was busted and didn&#39;t feel good to use. Even <em>I</em> didn&#39;t want to use it so changes had to be made. New Socii is super pleasant to use and I&#39;m happy again. What follows is a deep-dive into the history of the architecture and why I made the changes I made.</p>
<h2 id="10">1.0</h2>
<h3 id="microservices">Microservices</h3>
<p><strong>Horus</strong>: the notifier<br/><strong>Hu</strong>: the authenticator (user management)<br/><strong>Nemty</strong>: the emailer<br/><strong>Ra</strong>: the one who knows all (GraphQL)<br/><strong>Seshat</strong>: the keeper of records (post management)<br/><strong>Thoth</strong>: the media converter</p>
<h3 id="web-apps">Web Apps</h3>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong>: the pretty informational site<br/><strong>Network</strong>: the actual web app</p>
<h3 id="the-rest">The Rest</h3>
<p><strong>DigitalOcean</strong>: the server<br/><strong>Mailgun</strong>: backend for email delivery<br/><strong>MongoDB</strong>: the database</p>
<h2 id="how-it-worked">How it worked</h2>
<p>User visited <code>socii.network</code> and liked what they saw so they decided to sign up. Being a new user, they were logged in immediately. On the backend, Hu created the user and pinged Nemty with the user&#39;s email address. Nemty created and sent a welcome email to the user.</p>
<p>If the user decided to make a post, Seshat would get those details and save it to the database. Thoth took care of uploading the user&#39;s profile picture. Horus facilitated details of post actions (favorite, reply, &amp;c) to Nemty. Ra was the glue that held everything together.</p>
<h2 id="what-didnt-work">What didn&#39;t work</h2>
<h3 id="microservices-1">Microservices</h3>
<p>Adding a feature to one microservice often meant updating nearly all of them and that grew hella tedious. When Socii 1.0 was in development the web industry was super buzzed about microservices, everywhere! They would solve all your problems! In my case, they <strong>added</strong> more than removed problems. It is <em>fully possible</em> that I did not write them in the way microservices are <strong>supposed</strong> to be written but when most of the tutorials on the subject came from the <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> hive mind, you can understand how good information and examples (!!) are hard to come by.</p>
<h3 id="web-apps-1">Web Apps</h3>
<p>Like my microservices, I did not enjoy doing a lot of work on the Network and then realizing Marketing wasn&#39;t up to date with things ranging from a shade of blue to the modules powering the app. I did a <strong>lot</strong> of copy/pasting and it felt like I was doing something wrong. Tedium!</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-1">The Rest</h3>
<p>DigitalOcean and Mailgun have been doing well for me. In fact, I believe I&#39;m grandfathered into Mailgun&#39;s free tier due to the low volume of Socii&#39;s email output. I&#39;ve experienced zero issues with email deliverability so I&#39;d gladly pay for it (make Socii popular y&#39;all).</p>
<p>MongoDB? <em>Sigh</em></p>
<p>Like many front-end developers, I gravitated to it for my projects because it was the &quot;least scary&quot; database available. Plenty of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1279678">ORM</a>s are available for it and I used <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose">mongoose</a> for a while before transitioning to <a href="https://github.com/saintedlama/mongoist">mongoist</a> during one of the phases of the refactor (in total, there have been at least four phases).</p>
<p>The issue that stumped me for <em>at <strong>least</strong> a month</em> before urging me to investigate other databases involved updating the schema of posts and users. I forget the details exactly but I had a defined schema and exported the data to perform a database migration. The migration kept failing due to permission checks of some sort and no amount of search engine kung fu rescued me from my woes. Mongo is super unhelpful when things go wrong.</p>
<p>I ended up cursing myself for being so reliant on a database with piss-poor error messages.</p>
<h2 id="the-search">The Search</h2>
<h3 id="microservices-2">Microservices</h3>
<p>I had been using <a href="https://zeit.co">ZEIT</a>&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/zeit/micro">micro</a>/<a href="https://github.com/zeit/micro-dev">micro-dev</a> modules as the basis for my microservices but the lack of updates/<a href="https://github.com/zeit/micro-dev/issues/41">interest from the maintainers</a> urged me to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>I also read many articles about how companies like Airbnb and Netflix managed their software, to better inform my own decisions about the future of my microservices. In the realm of that research I learned about &quot;monorepos&quot; with the most popular NodeJS module being <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna">Lerna</a>. I decided not to use it but to implement one of the core features, which was to put all of my microservices into one API and go from there.</p>
<h3 id="web-apps-2">Web Apps</h3>
<p>The original Socii made extensive use of websockets in order to provide a responsive UI. That…worked…for a while. I soon realized I was merely replicating what single-page applications do.</p>
<p>The web industry&#39;s favorite framework for SPAs is (was?) React and I <em>despise</em> React. It has always seemed too bulky and I&#39;m allergic to packages with a boatload of dependencies.</p>
<p>Far too many times in my web development career I have been forced to stop using a useful package because of a dependency being out of date or suffering from a vulnerability and the author/maintainers of that dependency being unresponsive or plain not caring. Bulky packages also become targets for misuse. Companies like <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> exist to help mitigate this issue but the first step, IMHO, is to limit the attack area yourself by choosing smaller (often with full feature-parity) packages.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I looked at <a href="https://github.com/preactjs/preact">Preact</a>, <a href="https://github.com/composi">Composi</a>, and a lot of interesting HyperScript mini-frameworks before settling on <a href="https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js">Mithril</a>. I really thought this was <strong>IT</strong>. I found the perfect front-end framework! Right?! Heh, <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>The original codebase was server-side rendered which meant shared links in Apple Messages and elsewhere online showed rich metadata; title of the page, description, and Socii&#39;s icon image. With Mithril, I lost all that. Frustrated once more, it was back to the drawing board.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-2">The Rest</h3>
<p>Your service is only as good as your database.</p>
<p>Your database of choice is the jewel, the Big Kahuna, the very <em>foundation</em> of your service. So, I tested Apple&#39;s FoundationDB. Long story short, I found it relatively easy to setup but was confused about how I&#39;d put data into it&#39;s Document Layer (document data model on FoundationDB, implementing MongoDB&#39;s wire protocol; I&#39;d be able to plug &#39;n play, basically).</p>
<p>However, I did find an awesome NodeJS module written by Steve Korshakov, CEO of <a href="https://openland.com">Openland</a>: <a href="https://fdb.openland.com">@openland/foundationdb</a>. Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t have Document Layer support so my search continued.</p>
<p>No other database looked pleasant to use (to me). One of my developer friends espoused the beauty of MariaDB but I was spoiled by ORMs. I didn&#39;t want to learn how to write weird syntax just to interface with my database (I also didn&#39;t realize at the time that <a href="https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm">TypeORM</a> was a thing, which renders my previous sentence null).</p>
<h2 id="20">2.0</h2>
<h3 id="microservices-3">Microservices</h3>
<p>Five of the original six microservices I created were condensed into a single GraphQL API. The outlier was Thoth (media converter/file management) because as great as GraphQL is, it cannot handle file uploads as easy as a standard REST API could.</p>
<p>Instead, this is the process: when I need to upload something (like a profile picture for instance), the upload is happening in the background as soon as possible. The response from Thoth is the resulting URL from DigitalOcean&#39;s Spaces (basically AWS) that becomes a hidden input&#39;s value that will finally get sent to the API to be inserted into the database, after a user clicks &quot;save&quot;/&quot;upload&quot;.</p>
<p>Kind of convoluted but it works for now.</p>
<p>So, I now have two APIs: a GraphQL-based one (primary) and a REST-based one (file uploads). Both are built upon the <a href="https://github.com/restify/node-restify">restify</a> framework (it&#39;s like Express but focused on API creation).</p>
<h3 id="web-apps-3">Web Apps</h3>
<p>Back at the drawing board but <em>fully understanding</em> what my requirements were for a front-end framework, it didn&#39;t take me long to find another one of ZEIT&#39;s open-source projects, <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js">Next</a>. Alas, it was built upon React but if I could have an SSR-powered SPA I&#39;d swallow that. And so I did until approximately a week and a half later when I came across a <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/sapper-towards-the-ideal-web-app-framework">blog post</a> comparing Next and something called &quot;Sapper&quot;. This section of the post blew my mind (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The same ‘hello world&#39; app that took 204kb with React and Next weighs just 7kb with Sapper.</strong> That number is likely to fall further in the future as we explore the space of optimisation possibilities, such as not shipping any JavaScript <em>at all</em> for pages that aren&#39;t interactive, beyond the tiny Sapper runtime that handles client-side routing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sapper has Express-compatible middleware, making it easy to understand and customize for people who are used to using Express (and Fastify, Restify, &amp;c). It is built upon a framework that&#39;s not <em>really</em> a framework: Svelte. Like the name implies, Svelte compiles code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JavaScript. Quite honestly, this is everything I&#39;ve been looking for; a lightweight SPA with SSR support!</p>
<p>With the web app framework <em>finally</em> figured out, I had to then figure out what I wanted to do about having two front-ends to manage. And…I didn&#39;t want to manage two of them. I decided to merge them instead and deprecate the use of a sub-domain for the Network. So, if you were logged-in you would see the global feed but if you were logged-out you would see the marketing homepage. The navigation would also change accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-3">The Rest</h3>
<p>The database I settled upon is <a href="https://github.com/rethinkdb">RethinkDB</a>. An interesting choice considering that one of the most commented issues in one of its repos on Github is titled, &quot;<a href="https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/6747">is this project dead?</a>&quot;. Well, the original company behind it is but there&#39;s still a small, vibrant community around it that&#39;s been using Rethink in production for years.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Rethink is the <a href="https://rethinkdb.com/docs/administration-tools">web interface</a> it comes with (you can disable this if you want). This interface has a feature called &quot;Data Explorer&quot; and like the name implies, it allows you to test database commands (or, quickly query something from your database). Coming from a database that effectively told you nothing via opaque errors to a database that gave you the tools to succeed was a breath of fresh air and made me question why the company behind Rethink failed in the first place. The founder of the company, Slava Akhmechet, <a href="https://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">wrote about their failure</a> in depth and the TL;DR is: great product, wrong time.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>I believe I have created a stable foundation for the future of Socii&#39;s development. So, what&#39;s next? A laundry list of features: images in posts, more profile customization, groups, iOS app, re-enabled JSON Feed for profiles, end-to-end encryption, &amp;c. I don&#39;t have experience with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Development) workflows so maybe that&#39;ll be the next thing major thing I tackle. Of course, I&#39;ll share my experiences along the way.</p>

        <updated>2019-06-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where we're going is...fascinating and unknown.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://2016.dsgn.io/thoughts/post/the-future-of-the-operating-system" title="The Future of the Operating System">Back in 2013</a> I penned an essay titled, &quot;The Future of the Operating System.&quot; In it, I attempted to predict where the operating system paradigm was headed based on what was obvious to me at the time: cloud services were taking off and mobile devices were seeing greater usage than personal computers. Logically (to me), this meant the concept of a responsive OS was upon us. Some of the cited examples were <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS" title="Wikipedia article for Firefox OS">Firefox OS</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edge" title="Wikipedia article for Ubuntu Edge">Ubuntu Edge</a>, products that were both designed to be highly mobile primary computing devices that would dock to an apparatus on one&#39;s desk to become a full-fledged workstation. The essay was also an opportunity to plug my OS <em>in-progress</em> (now dormant), <a href="https://hikar.io" title="hikari OS">hikari</a>, built around the responsive OS concept.</p>
<p>For now, a rectangular slab of glass and metal that more or less fits in the palm of an adult hand appears to be the preferred format for a mobile computing device. Specific details and component internals can and will change but the external <em>probably</em> won&#39;t change much so no time will be spent talking about that. Instead, I&#39;ll go over my favorite UI concepts that inventive minds have created in the half-decade since my inital opus.</p>
<h3 id="edex-ui"><a href="https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui">eDEX-UI</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.</p>
<p>Heavily inspired from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170511000410/http://jtnimoy.com/blogs/projects/14881671">TRON Legacy movie effects</a> (especially the <a href="https://gmunk.com/TRON-Board-Room" title="TRON Board Room case study">Board Room sequence</a>), the eDEX-UI project was originally meant to be <em>&quot;<a href="https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui" title="DEX UI repo">DEX-UI</a> with less « art » and more « distributable software »&quot;</em>. While keeping a futuristic look and feel, it strives to maintain a certain level of functionality and to be usable in real-life scenarios, with the larger goal of bringing science-fiction UXs to the mainstream.</p>
<p>It might or might not be a joke taken too seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-a.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-a.png" alt="eDEX-UI screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-b.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-b.png" alt="eDEX-UI screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-c.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-c.png" alt="eDEX-UI screenshot"/></a></p>
<p>The on-screen keyboard suggests the use of this UI on a large touchscreen table (like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PixelSense" title="Wikipedia article for Microsoft PixelSense">Microsoft&#39;s PixelSense</a> or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=oblivion+table&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" title="DuckDuckGo image search for &#39;oblivion table&#39;">Oblivion&#39;s Light Table</a>) or at least the 12&quot; iPad Pro. Despite what some would consider &quot;visual noise&quot;, this UI has almost everything one would need for text entry and multitasking.</p>
<p>I personally don&#39;t see myself using a UI like this because of limited color palette. It looks wonderful for focus though.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it is fun to look at and pretend you&#39;re in a future where hoverboards are actually real and not 🤬 batteries on wheels.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-neo"><a href="https://desktopneo.com">Desktop Neo</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Neo is a conceptual desktop operating system interface that is built for todays people, needs and technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-d.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-d.jpg" alt="Desktop Neo screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-e.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-e.jpg" alt="Desktop Neo screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-f.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-f.png" alt="Desktop Neo screenshot"/></a></p>
<p>This UI is all about fullscreen <em>everything</em>. Window manager lovers would be so into this (looking at you, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn" title="unixporn subreddit...this is not *actual* porn, just UI inspiration">/r/unixporn</a> community). Heck, <strong>I</strong> am into this! All day every day I am <em>constantly</em> resizing/swiping/moving windows around.</p>
<p>The panel concept of this UI is nice and the search functionality sounds like something I <strong>need</strong>. I am currently on the beta for macOS Catalina and it <em>almost</em> has the concept down but you can only split two windows, max.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-g.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-g.png" alt="macOS Catalina, splitscreen"/></a></p>
<p>I do like how productive it makes me feel so maybe I&#39;ll become a heavy user of it (and hope Apple expands on the feature). Of the UI concepts showcased here, Desktop Neo is my favorite.</p>
<h3 id="mercury"><a href="https://www.mercuryos.com">Mercury</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mercury is a speculative reimagining of the operating system as a fluid experience driven by human intent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No Apps or Folders. Mercury fluidly assembles content and actions based on your intentions. So you can focus on the destination, not the many ways to get there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-h.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-h.png" alt="Mercury screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-i.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-i.png" alt="Mercury screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-j.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-j.png" alt="Mercury screenshot"/></a><br/><a href="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-k.png"><img src="/assets/images/2019/future-of-the-os-k.png" alt="Mercury screenshot"/></a></p>
<p>This is interesting because it completely strips away the desktop paradigm and creates something that aims to intuit what you&#39;ll do based on previous interactions. Basically, local machine learning to help you be more productive.</p>
<p>Mercury makes <strong>heavy</strong> use of shortcuts and search to get around, so this isn&#39;t the UI for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>The mockups show email messages and some neat things around that but nothing else. It&#39;d be interesting to see how a web browser would look. How do I see all my apps? The creator of Mercury says there aren&#39;t any apps but come on, <em>of course there are</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m excited to see where Mercury heads but for now, it just looks like a nice email app.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>A key issue I have with every UI concept mentioned here (and nearly every one on the Internet) is the lack of real work being done within them. Outside of a email or text prompt, you rarely see how a coder would use it. Or an analyst. Or a designer. Or anyone being productive, period.</p>
<p>A common thread that brings these concepts together is, <em>focus</em>. Another is <em>change</em> (obviously). After all, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor">desktop metaphor</a> as we know it was created in 1970. <strong>Nineteen seventy</strong>. What you are reading right now was written in 2019, nearly 50 <em>years</em> later and...not much has changed.</p>
<p>As I am wont to do, I think about lapsed projects of mine and wonder what would warrant further development. In hikari&#39;s case, it doesn&#39;t make sense to simply recreate the tried-and-true desktop metaphor. If my aim is to solve problems inherent to a dated paradigm, keeping with the status quo is <em>not</em> the way to go.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Apple&#39;s iOS is massively popular is because users don&#39;t have to think about files and folders, a chief tenant of the desktop paradigm.</p>
<p>So...where do we go from here?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t pretend to have the answer but I think we&#39;re <em>slowly</em> going in the right direction.</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2019/facebook-and-their-bullshit"/>
        <updated>2019-03-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Platitudes, promises, and piss-poor policies]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634">published an essay</a> where he promises a &quot;A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking&quot;. The optimist would say he&#39;s learned the error of his/Facebook&#39;s ways, the pessimist would write the entire thing off, and the realist would assume this is reactionary posturing due to the fact that Facebook is experiencing &quot;an estimated 15 million fewer users in the United States compared to 2017&quot; (according to <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions">Edison Research</a>).</p>
<p>I am in the latter two camps but I&#39;m particularly incensed about how brazen the Zuck continues to be in his lying. It <em>is</em> a new era so maybe this is his new normal. Let&#39;s dissect his several &quot;promises&quot; (bold text inside quotes represent emphasis I&#39;ve added).</p>
<h3 id="reducing-permanence">Reducing Permanence</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People should be comfortable being themselves, and should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later. So <strong>we won&#39;t keep messages or stories around for longer than necessary</strong> to deliver the service or longer than people want them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long is &quot;necessary&quot;? Facebook stores what you&#39;ve typed in the post box but you&#39;ve <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/14/facebook-says-new-bug-allowed-apps-access-private-photos-up-million-users">have not sent</a></em> or <em><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/12/facebook-self-censorship-what-happens-to-the-posts-you-dont-publish.html">you deleted</a></em>. It is completely unnecessary to store that information in the first place, let alone for an indeterminate amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="encryption-and-safety">Encryption and Safety</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People should expect that <strong>we will do everything we can to keep them safe on our services</strong> within the limits of what&#39;s possible in an encrypted service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People <em>did</em> expect this and some hope that Facebook tries harder. Making private information availble to third-parties in order to make money isn&#39;t how you protect people. In Facebook&#39;s case, protecting users in this way comes into direct conflict with their desire to make money. This is why they are so conflicted about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, there are real safety concerns to address before we can implement end-to-end encryption across all of our messaging services. <strong>Encryption is a powerful tool for privacy, but that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.</strong> When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can. <strong>We are working to improve our ability to identify and stop bad actors across our apps by detecting patterns of activity or through other means</strong>, even when we can&#39;t see the content of the messages, and we will continue to invest in this work. But we face an inherent tradeoff because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple things to unpack here. Zuckerberg delivered the flawed argument of [insert tech here] should not be used because criminals exist. This is a straw man argument. The mere <em>existence</em> of a particular technology isn&#39;t going to make law enforcement&#39;s jobs impossible, just like it isn&#39;t going to enable criminals to be untouchable. Criminals and law enforcement are locked in a perpetual arms race (sometimes literally) and will continue to be until the heat death of the Universe and then some.</p>
<p>Sounds like Facebook is trying to figure out how to create a &quot;secure back door&quot; and we all know that doesn&#39;t exist. At which point we&#39;ll get an apology and a &quot;pledge to do better&quot; when the inevitable data hack and resulting leak occurs. 😴</p>
<h3 id="secure-data-storage">Secure data storage</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>People should expect that <strong>we won&#39;t store sensitive data in countries with weak records on human rights</strong> like privacy and freedom of expression in order to protect data from being improperly accessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Reeeeeeally</em>. China? They exist. They also have nearly 1.5 BILLION people. No way Facebook is giving up the chance to get a slice of that pie.</p>
<p>WeChat is what Facebook aspires to be, but like any company that wants to do business in China, you&#39;ve gotta have servers there because the Chinese government demands it.</p>
<p>Apple recently had to put servers in China <em>just</em> for their mainland customers. However, Apple has a proven track record in regards to privacy and end-to-end encryption so I am less worried about Chinese dissidents using iPhones than I am about them using Facebook for literally anything.</p>
<p>Like Zuckerberg stated in his essay, encryption has saved countless dissidents from being murdered but I am not confident in Facebook&#39;s ability to protect them.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Facebook&#39;s profits are up but positive public perception is <em>plummeting</em>. It&#39;s difficult not to think of Zuckerberg&#39;s &quot;candidness&quot; as sweet talk to entice Gen Z&#39;ers and millennials back to the platform and to make your auntie feel safe because &quot;the guy who made the site said so&quot;.</p>
<p>However, Mark Zuckerberg does a great job of stressing the importance of social networks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Public social networks will continue to be very important in people&#39;s lives -- for connecting with everyone you know, discovering new people, ideas and content, and giving people a voice more broadly. People find these valuable every day, and there are still a lot of useful services to build on top of them. But now, <strong>with all the ways people also want to interact privately, there&#39;s also an opportunity to build a simpler platform that&#39;s focused on privacy first.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Problem is, I don&#39;t think he believes his own words.</p>
<p>Is Facebook being refactored? Are they really going back to the original vision, to make the world feel smaller and more personable? Or is he talking about <a href="/2017/who-creates-social-networks">my social network in progress</a>, <a href="https://socii.network">Socii</a>?</p>
<p>Between my day job helping create a <a href="https://lbry.tech">decentralized content platform</a> and creating Socii, I&#39;ve got my hands full and I&#39;m also super passionate about protecting my family, friends, and cool folks on the Internet like yourself.</p>
<p>Y&#39;know, focused on privacy first. 🕸</p>

        <id>https://blog.webb.page/2019/neat-npm-01</id>
        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2019/neat-npm-01"/>
        <updated>2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The modules you wish you used]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post in what will become a series of posts about interesting and useful npm modules I come across and/or use in my projects.</p>
<p>Over the past year, small modules that got to the point and had close to zero dependencies (dependency-free is even better!) became more appealing to me for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Big modules are slow to update. When a vulnerability is found in one of their dependencies the module maintainers are notified and then...nothing. Sometimes the maintainers never respond so someone forks the project, updates the dependencies, and pushes that project under a new name. When security issues are discovered, I want them resolved ASAP. Smaller modules have less attack area, obviously. Fewer moving parts, &amp;c.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">left-pad incident</a> and similarly befuddling things happening in the npm ecosphere give me pause about relying on a module with a bajillion moving parts. TL;DR: A popular module used by <em>thousands</em> of other modules was unpublished (removed) from npm and that caused <em>quite</em> the fuss when routine <code>npm install</code>s went off the rails across the Internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that <code>package.json</code> examples below only have the necessary parameters regarding the section its in. This is for brevity. New developers come into being every day I&#39;d like to help them out by removing possible confusion.</p>
<h3 id="colorette">colorette</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Colorette is a Node.js library for colorizing text in terminals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people just use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk">chalk</a> to style terminal text and I did too. When I saw I could get the same functionality in a smaller dependency-free package, I jumped at the chance to use it. chalk does and supports a lot more but for <strong>my</strong> needs, colorette is <em>juuuuust</em> fine.</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/colorette">npm</a> | <a href="https://github.com/jorgebucaran/colorette">GitHub</a></p>
<h3 id="husky">husky</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Husky can prevent bad git commit, git push and more 🐶 woof!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m honestly <strong>embarrassed</strong> that I haven&#39;t used something like husky earlier in life. <strong>husky saves you from <em>yourself</em></strong> and what a beautiful job it does. Here&#39;s how I use it in my <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;husky&quot;: {
  &quot;hooks&quot;: {
    &quot;pre-commit&quot;: &quot;npm run format &amp;&amp; npm run test:sass &amp;&amp; git add -A :/&quot;
  }
},
&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;format&quot;: &quot;eslint &#39;**/*.js&#39; --fix --ignore-pattern &#39;/app/dist/&#39;&quot;,
  &quot;test:sass&quot;: &quot;sass-lint --config ./node_modules/@inc/sasslint-config/config.json --verbose --no-exit&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>What my pre-commit hook does is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use eslint to automatically format issues in JavaScript files found in the codebase, except for JavaScript files in the folder <code>/app/dist/</code>.</li>
<li>Use sass-lint and a custom configuration file to find issues in Sass files found in the codebase.</li>
<li>Stage (prepare) the changed files, if any, to be committed to my git server (I self-host with Gitea but this works with any git server).</li>
</ol>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky">npm</a> | <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky">GitHub</a></p>
<h3 id="npm-run-all">npm-run-all</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A CLI tool to run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or sequential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s how I use it in my <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;test&quot;: &quot;run-s test:*&quot;,
  &quot;test:dependencies&quot;: &quot;updates --update ./ --exclude fastify&quot;,
  &quot;test:lint&quot;: &quot;standardx --verbose | snazzy&quot;,
  &quot;test:sass&quot;: &quot;sass-lint --config ./node_modules/@inc/sasslint-config/config.json --verbose --no-exit&quot;,
  &quot;watch&quot;: &quot;run-p watch:*&quot;,
  &quot;watch:sass&quot;: &quot;sass --watch app/sass:app/dist --style compressed&quot;,
  &quot;watch:server&quot;: &quot;NODE_ENV=development nodemon server&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p><code>run-s</code> runs scripts sequentially, whereas <code>run-p</code> runs scripts in parallel. You&#39;ve probably guessed by now but <code>run-s test:*</code> tells npm-run-all to run any script with &quot;test:&quot;, one after the other. <code>run-p watch:*</code> tells it run any script with &quot;watch:&quot;, side by side. I like it a lot.</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all">npm</a> | <a href="https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all">GitHub</a></p>
<h3 id="updates">updates</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast npm dependency updating tool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found updates after being frustrated with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates">npm-check-updates</a>. One of the maintainers of the latter was <a href="https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates/issues/432">uninterested</a> in updating the dependencies. Forking and working on npm-check-updates myself proved to be annoying so I went looking for solutions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how I use it in my <code>package.json</code> (fastify is working on their next version and it&#39;s messing with this script so I ignore updating it for now):</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;test:dependencies&quot;: &quot;updates --update ./ --exclude fastify&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/updates">npm</a> | <a href="https://github.com/silverwind/updates">GitHub</a></p>
<h3 id="ver">ver</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Increment semantic versions across your project. Intended for projects with a package.json, but works with other files too. Will create a git commit and tag by default. By default, only the nearest package.json file is modified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before ver, I never cared about &quot;semantic versioning&quot;, let alone versioning <em>itself</em>. ver makes it super low effort to do. I just run <code>ver patch|minor|major</code> and chain it with other commands. It will automatically update the &quot;version&quot; field in your <code>package.json</code> file. Pretty sweet.</p>
<p>My typical usage is something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ver patch &amp;&amp; git push &amp;&amp; npm publish</code></pre>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ver">npm</a> | <a href="https://github.com/silverwind/ver">GitHub</a></p>
<h3 id="">—</h3>
<p>And there you have it! Five neat modules I find incredibly useful. I hope you do too! 🕸</p>

        <updated>2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What. A. Year.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So much has happened this year, not just for me but my wife as well. Let&#39;s dig in.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 id="i-quit-instagram">I quit Instagram</h3>
<p>A year prior I quit Facebook proper but it seemed disingenuous to continue using Instagram. Knowing that I was still in FB Land made me feel gross so my last post was New Years Day.</p>
<h3 id="attained-wakandan-citizenship">Attained Wakandan Citizenship</h3>
<p>Black Panther was the greatest movie of the year. I want <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Kimoyo_Beads" title="Information about Kimoyo Beads">Kimoyo Beads</a> <em>badly</em>.</p>
<h3 id="moved-to-tennessee">Moved to Tennessee</h3>
<p>Family friends invited us to stay with them while 1) I found a new job and 2) we found a home of our own. I <strong>would not</strong> recommend this as it was stressful in several annoying ways but it was only four months. Lessons learned?</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust your gut (in hindsight, I should have seen my layoff coming)</li>
<li>Have a savings fund</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="got-more-serious-about-projects">Got more serious about projects</h3>
<p><a href="https://socii.network" title="My social network">Socii</a> saw improvements, <a href="https://chew.sh" title="My analytics service">Chew</a> was launched, and I released some <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vne" title="A clever .env">open-source</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chewit" title="Analytics you can count on">modules</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inc/eslint-config" title="Recommended ESLint settings for !NC projects">and</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inc/sasslint-config" title="Recommended Sass Lint settings for !NC projects">configs</a> on npm.</p>
<p>Along the way, I discovered better &quot;good practices&quot; and I&#39;m keen on improving them further in the new year.</p>
<p>Oh, and I transitioned from GitLab to <a href="https://gitea.io" title="A painless self-hosted Git service">Gitea</a>. GitLab is a resource hog and reminds of old Wordpress. I am much happier with Gitea and it is customizable! I haven&#39;t done any customization though, haha.</p>
<p>My wife delved into sewing more, improved her skills tenfold, and is becoming known in the sewing community. I now have intermediate knowledge about cover stiches and what stiches look like when using 1-3 needles.</p>
<h3 id="bought-more-indie-music">Bought more indie music</h3>
<p>Stream life is just not for me, at least music-wise. Tidal, Spotify, Apple Music...none of it sticks with me. I&#39;ve found myself using Bandcamp a lot more this year and I mean a LOT.</p>
<p>Some awesome musicians I&#39;ve discovered are <a href="https://lakimisalive.bandcamp.com">LAKIM</a>, <a href="https://macross82-99.bandcamp.com">マクロスMACROSS 82-99</a>, <a href="https://ericlau.bandcamp.com">Eric Lau</a>, <a href="https://dentmay.bandcamp.com">Dent May</a>, <a href="https://theplaylist.bandcamp.com">The PLAYlist</a>, <a href="https://leyawn.bandcamp.com">leon chang</a>, <a href="https://yungbaebae.bandcamp.com">YUNG BAE</a>...I could keep going but that small list should keep your ears busy for a couple hours.</p>
<h3 id="fin">FIN</h3>
<p>For the past couple years I&#39;ve ended my annual review posts with my top nine popular Instagram posts but since I don&#39;t use that platform anymore...here are some favorited images from my phone.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/yir.jpg" alt="My favorite photos from the past few months"/></p>
<p>This time next year, Socii will have photo functionality. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's about time I got some things rolling]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It could be argued that you do not (should not) need to wait for a new year to begin just to follow new goals and dreams. However, a new year symbolizes rebirth and new beginnings. A chance to begin anew...and so on. With that said, here is a list of things I want to accomplish in the new year.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>iOS development has always been something on my &quot;yeah, at some point&quot; mental list but in the past week I realized that I need to learn it to create a client for my social network. I purchased some courses from <a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com">Ray Wenderlich</a>&#39;s site eons ago and am <em>just now</em> going through it. That reminds me, I have <strong>plenty</strong> of courses purchased from Udemy that I have not revisited (8 of them involve Blender and/or using Blender with Unity)...I will get back to them, at some point.</p>
<h3 id="product-launches">Product Launches</h3>
<p>I had an epiphany a couple weeks ago regarding online products and services. When you distill them to the basics, <strong>what people are paying for/getting is access to an API wrapped in a UI</strong>.</p>
<p>This gave me the sudden realization that a majority of my planned products (projects really) have suffered from me getting stuck on the UI. A friend called it &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; and that sums it up <em>perfectly</em>. I came into the tech space via web design and development, so I am trained to think of the UI first and foremost. However, as the back-end developer as well I have to <em>adjust my thinking</em> to prioritize the functionality over how pretty something looks/feels. This may sound like a no-brainer to you, dear reader, but when you are inside your own head it is not so obvious. The functionality informs the UI/UX and vice-versa, it&#39;s a balance.</p>
<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of just <em>some</em> of my languished projects I would love to turn into products:</p>
<ul>
<li>web browser</li>
<li>domain portfolio management tool</li>
<li>web app deployer</li>
<li>analytics service</li>
<li>operating system</li>
<li>process management for servers</li>
<li>content-management system</li>
<li>IMAP server proxy and client</li>
<li>social network</li>
<li>eCommerce platform</li>
<li>lifestyle brand</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are already in active progress and I think it is totally possible to achieve 90% of this list by next year&#39;s end.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I used to produce music and rap over my own beats and it gave me another outlet to express myself. Retro/futuristic/jazzy beats and (I thought) dope rhymes, haha! A number of factors contributed to the demise of that particular activity, least of which was starting a family. In my pre-family days I could have complete silence and uninterrupted workflow for hours. That simply does not exist for me now.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I could get back to creating music in many small spurts of time. What a luxury, time is.</p>
<h3 id="video">Video</h3>
<p>I upgrade my iPhone every year and the camera gets better year over year. Additionally, I have a couple ideas for short films so I should be taking full advantage of this fantastically capable device. I have a Vimeo account for a <em>reason</em>. Yeesh.</p>
<h3 id="and">And...</h3>
<p>As usual, I just want to become a better version of myself and hopefully not deal with much strife on the way. Parenting is hard, relationships are hard, <em>life</em> is hard. My quest to make things a bit easier, continues. 🕸</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2018/the-fallacy-of-imposter-syndrome"/>
        <updated>2018-08-22T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who's holding the carrot?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You (or, someone you know) has claimed to suffer from imposter syndrome at some point in time. But what <em>is</em> it, really?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Impostor syndrome</strong> is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a &quot;fraud&quot;, despite external evidence of their competence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m speaking from the lens of someone firmly entrenched in the web industry, but what I&#39;m about to say applies anywhere. Imposter syndrome appears to be a very real threat to the psyche. It has occurred to me that maybe...<em>it&#39;s not</em>.</p>
<p>Y&#39;see, when people reach the next plateau of their career they begin to compare themselves against impossible odds. They look at the &quot;superstar&quot; members of their industry, they look at their peers of similar standing, <strong>they look at everything around and beyond them</strong>. I mean, just check out that <em>view</em>! What happens next <del>will</del> won&#39;t shock you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did I get here? I don&#39;t <strong>belong</strong> here! What if they <em>know</em>?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are questions people ask themselves instead of the one that <em>matters</em> as they turn around:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wow</strong>, I really came <em>this</em> far? 🤩</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our fast-paced society and the scripted nature of social media where we only display accomplishments and accolades encourages us to keep our figurative necks on a swivel. <strong>Mentally, we <em>all</em> have full range of motion.</strong> Not just laterally and up, but backwards too! It&#39;s important to acknowledge your accomplishments to yourself. Internalize it. Believe it!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s think about this another way.</p>
<p>Imagine someone riding a horse with a long stick in hand. On that stick is an equally long string with a carrot tied to the end. The horse sees the carrot and starts to trot towards it. The horse jockey moves the carrot when they want the horse to change direction. Now, replace the carrot with everything you saw on that plateau and the horse with yourself. PLOT TWIST, you are <em>also</em> the horse jockey.</p>
<p><em>WHUUUUUH?!</em></p>
<p>Get off the horse and give them a salt lick for doing a <del>good</del> <del>great</del> <em>fantastic</em> job. Huh, interesting...that salt lick is suspiciously similar to your personal accomplishments.</p>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>You&#39;re awesome. Stop beating yourself up. Stop and smell the roses of your accomplishments thus far. Know when to use blinders. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ship often!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess this is turning into a bi-monthly update? Don&#39;t fret, the silence doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t progress being made. Let&#39;s jump in.</p>
<h3 id="quick-life-update">Quick life update</h3>
<p>I got a (remote) job! And a house! Kids are happy, wife is happy, so I&#39;m happy.</p>
<h3 id="json-feed-support">JSON Feed support</h3>
<p>Every profile is now equipped with <a href="https://jsonfeed.org">JSON Feed</a> support! Created by Manton Reece and Brent Simmons, JSON Feed aims to be the new RSS. To access your feed (or others), append <code>/feed</code> to a user&#39;s profile page. Here&#39;s an example:</p>
<pre><code>https://hub.socii.network/Socii/feed</code></pre><p>Your feed is now available for whatever you wish to use it for. Maybe you want to display your latest posts on your personal site? Have a customized dashboard? Put &#39;er there!</p>
<p>Socii is a social network, yes, but not one that wants to keep you on it all the time. Your data is yours.</p>
<h3 id="gdpr">GDPR</h3>
<p>By now you&#39;ve seen the emails and memes as a result of the passing of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. Long story short, it&#39;s a collection of data protections passed into law for European citizens. This means, companies are required to protect data pertaining to any users from Europe and to also deliver or delete said data should the user request it.</p>
<p>Unlike the major social networks here in America, I didn&#39;t opt to have two versions of privacy policies for users in Europe and those outside. EVERYONE deserves to have their data protected, exported, and/or deleted at a whim. To echo the words of Childish Gambino, &quot;this is America&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, GDPR isn&#39;t <em>perfect</em> but it&#39;s a step in the right direction. To that end, I&#39;ve updated the <a href="https://socii.network/policies">policies</a> page to be more comprehensive about the data Socii collects, how that data is used, email addresses of the Data Controller and Data Controller officer, and so on. I dislike that it&#39;s so long though…I may bring back the TL;DR version from before and have a toggle to see both. Yeah, that&#39;s a great idea!</p>
<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>
<p>This was a long time coming. When you favorite or respond to a post, the author will get a beautifully simple email stating such.</p>
<p>The notifications tab on the hub is still empty for now but I <strong>could not wait</strong> to ship the workable part of this feature.</p>
<p><code>@ mention</code> support for notifications will come shortly. This will pave the way for private messages as well.</p>
<h3 id="performance-gains">Performance gains</h3>
<p>Yes! <em>FINALLY</em>. You wanna know why loading of <code>hub.socii.network</code> was so slow? I was literally loading…every…single…post before displaying the hub. Over time the wait got progressively worse because there were more posts to load.</p>
<p>Enough was enough and after I shipped notifications, I got to work on implementing GraphQL-based pagination. I had this implemented <em>partially</em> for about a month or so but other issues plagued me more than the slowness of the hub. Pagination is <em>also</em>  active on profile pages. It may not be perfect but it&#39;s close.</p>
<p>A blog post to detail how to do pagination in GraphQL without Apollo, Prisma, or whatever magic framework is forthcoming. I&#39;ve had developers attached to the GraphQL project tell me that pagination is <a href="https://github.com/howtographql/howtographql/issues/514">trivial</a>, unimportant, or easy, both on GitHub and Slack. Or, that I <strong>need</strong> to use yet <em>another</em> framework to achieve it.</p>
<p>Good thing there are other places to find help. No matter how much I learn, I remember knowing <em>a lot less</em>. I feel obligated to pass on the knowledge of dope things. Stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="low-hanging-fruit-and-other-changes">Low-hanging fruit and other changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Email addresses can now have <code>+</code> and <code>.</code> characters, perfect for having multiple accounts and using email aliases.</li>

        <updated>2018-05-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rah rah, fight the powah!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is a combination of at least <em>three</em> different posts I intended to write and publish over the past year. They inevitably came to the similar conclusions and it makes sense. In my mind, decentralization and privacy are mutually beneficial. In the wake of exposure to privacy violations by Google, Facebook, &amp;c to the general public, it seemed like now would be a great time to share my thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not paying for it, you&#39;re not the customer; you&#39;re the product being sold. — <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046" title="Andrew Lewis&#39; classic quote on MetaFilter">Andrew Lewis (blue_beetle)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This oft-referenced quote was posted on MetaFilter on August 26th, 2010. It&#39;s been nearly a decade since then and clearly, that quote is timeless. The increasingly parasitic advertising industry is fed by a never-ending supply of user-data gathered and sold by almost every <del>online</del> <del>offline</del> service. Oh yeah, that&#39;s right; you can be tracked <em>offline</em>. The data gatherers are your usual suspects: Facebook, Google, Twitter, as well as unknown data brokers of which new ones are launching seemingly weekly. Have you looked at the blacklist of your favorite ad blocker? It&#39;s a <em>mess</em>.</p>
<p>The aforementioned data gatherers are in the business of keeping your attention. The visual redesigns, additional features, and so on are not created to make a better product for your perusal. Oh no, these changes are A/B tested and analyzed to ensure that you spend as much time using those products as possible. Why? So that app can send usage data and patterns back to the mothership to collect your info to update their algorithms and sell to advertisers for a pretty penny and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Before this year, casual Internet users would roll their eyes at everything I&#39;ve said thus far, <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>, and say something inane like, &quot;It is what is is.&quot; or, &quot;I have nothing to hide.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguing that you don&#39;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don&#39;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. — Edward Snowden</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frustrating as those eye rolls may be, you cannot force someone to care about something <strong>you</strong> think is important. I&#39;ve been harping on about privacy to my friends for years and some of them are starting to come around. The tech (and mainstream) media&#39;s continued coverage about the evils of (mostly) Facebook and Google has become a roar too loud to ignore.</p>
<p>FINALLY.</p>
<p>People have realized (or are starting to realize) that they can no longer depend on the kindness of corporations offering free things on the Internet...when you think of it that way, it&#39;s kind of surprising that we would think there wouldn&#39;t be strings attached. Huh. Anyhoo, getting away from Facebook is <em>relatively</em> easy. Ironically, if you have a lot of relatives on the platform, leaving is quite difficult.</p>
<h3 id="cancel-facebook">Cancel Facebook</h3>
<p>Your entrenchment level with Facebook varies with the next person and most likely with me too. I&#39;ll share what I did leading up to and after my leave from Facebook in 2016.</p>
<ol>
<li>I requested a backup of my data.</li>
<li>After downloading my data, I went to my profile page and spent a couple days deleting posts. This was tedious as hell and I never actually finished. I think I got through my first three years and then my recent two years before calling it quits with that task.</li>
<li>I also deleted integrations with other services and took the time to delete accounts with services I barely remembered using prior the integration deletion.</li>
<li>I told close friends, family, and my girlfriend (now wife) my plans and why I was doing so. I have several family members on Facebook but I also own a phone. I had zero interest with staying in contact with people I knew from high school, those were all passive &quot;friendships&quot; at that point.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cancel-google">Cancel Google</h3>
<p>Hoo boy, this one&#39;s a <em>doozy</em>. Entire livelihoods, businesses, and lifestyles rely on Google in some shape or form...<em>especially</em> if your daily mobile driver is an Android device. I grew weary of Google long before my divorce from Facebook and I found an email replacement in <a href="https://mailinabox.email" title="Super awesome self-hosted email solution">Mail-in-a-Box</a>, a self-hosted email solution that also has calendar and address book capabilities. For search, I use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" title="A damn good search engine that doesn&#39;t track you">DuckDuckGo</a>. I&#39;m on iOS/macOS so Apple Maps is a suitable Google Maps replacement for me (btw, Apple Maps is <strong>fantastic</strong> in Japan).</p>
<p>At this point in time, YouTube is nigh-<em>impossible</em> to replace. Nintendo doesn&#39;t upload their videos to Vimeo. MKBHD or any other super profitable YouTube creator isn&#39;t leaving the platform anytime soon either so it&#39;s a total crapshoot. I&#39;m no longer logged-in to YouTube but I still get email notifications when a channel I&#39;m interested in uploads a video. For videos I <em>really</em> want to see again, I download them with <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl" title="Download online videos from pretty much anywhere">youtube-dl</a>, an awesome command line program that is capable of downloading videos from pretty much any video sharing site (not just YouTube). Here&#39;s my configuration file (located at <code>~/.config/youtube-dl/config</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">-f bestvideo+bestaudio
-o ~/Movies/%(title)s.%(ext)s</code></pre>
<p>It automatically downloads the best audio and best video sources for whatever video URL you supply and combines them to create a single file. That file then gets saved to my <code>~/Movies</code> folder. I alias the <code>youtube-dl</code> command in my <code>.zshrc</code> config so I can type <code>yt</code> followed by a URL for a super-quick workflow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google Apps for Work exists and that means I have not fully escaped their ecosystem. When it comes to most businesses, familiarity and cost-savings often take precedence over ideals. Make no mistake, finding (worthy) alternatives to every single one of Google&#39;s offerings is expensive in either time spent searching or cost for a single app. Sometimes both! However, I think the upfront cost is worth the longtime gain. You will have to be careful though. There is no shortage of startups with compelling products that are merely skins on top of Google&#39;s existing services (last year I interviewed for such a company that I thought was creating a compelling email client only to learn that it was really Gmail underneath AND there would be no IMAP support...the conversation made our misalignment apparent).</p>
<h3 id="decentralization">Decentralization</h3>
<p>As my concerns about online privacy grew, so did my interest in decentralization. The core premise of decentralization is basically self-hosting any online service you may need, yourself. The open-source community is <em>fantastic</em> for that. You may find some projects with plenty of issues in their git repos and design/code quality of varying degrees of excellence but they are <strong>all</strong> great bases to get started from.</p>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of decentralization is discovering a codebase someone shared eons prior and finding out that a particular function (or even the entire codebase) fits in perfectly with whatever I&#39;m working on. It sometimes feels like spelunking. You&#39;ll never know what you find but treasures await! My other favorite aspect of it is knowing that <strong>I</strong> am in control of my data. There&#39;s no ambiguity there. I don&#39;t have to trust a third-party, I can trust myself. After all, I wrote the code (or adapted it after I read through it).</p>
<p><strong>A key aspect of decentralization that scares non-tech-savvy people is self-hosting.</strong> Of course I can say that it&#39;s no big deal but that&#39;s because I&#39;ve been doing this for years. Some tech-savvy people just don&#39;t want to deal with server updates and the like. I totally get that because maintenance <em>can</em> be a drag. You&#39;ve really got to decide what you want for yourself. Personally, I think self-hosting is important and I advise everyone to try it at least once. Even if it&#39;s just to get over that fear of purchasing (well, <em>leasing</em>) a $5/month server from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" title="VPS provider">DigitalOcean</a> or <a href="https://www.exoscale.com" title="Another VPS provider, but in Europe">Exoscale</a> to hack on and test things with.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a list of things I self-host:</p>
<ul>
<li>CMS: <a href="https://git.inc.sh/IdeasNeverCease/Noto" title="Just some code I wrote">Noto</a> (super simple Markdown-based &quot;CMS&quot; I created that runs the blog you&#39;re reading right now)</li>
<li>Email: <a href="https://mailinabox.email" title="Super awesome self-hosted email solution">Mail-in-a-Box</a> (this is <em>super</em> simple to setup)</li>
<li>Git: <a href="https://gitea.io" title="A community-mangaged fork of Gogs">Gitea</a> (MUCH lighter than GitLab and more customizable too)</li>
</ul>
<p>If self-hosting is not your thing, you can sign up and/or join servers other people have created. For example, <a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon</a> is a decentralized Twitter-like social network. You can fire up your own Mastodon instance or you can sign up for one and start chatting with people. I&#39;m taking the opposite approach with the social network I&#39;m developing but I intend to add decentralized features to it, like PubSub support.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I am working on a social network and an analytics service because 1) I was not able to find exactly what I was looking for, and 2) if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself. I&#39;ve already detailed my <a href="/2017/who-creates-social-networks" title="Who the hell creates a social network?">reasons for starting a social network</a> before but I never published anything about the analytics service.</p>
<p>Plain and simple, I abhor trackers. However, I enjoy viewing stats that tell me how many people visit my site, the most popular link visited today, and so on. I was using <a href="https://gaug.es" title="Analytics provider that keeps getting sold">Gauges</a> prior to creating <a href="https://chew.sh" title="Just some analytics service I created">Chew</a> and one of my tech-savvy friends expressed to me that while he knows who I am and can trust me, he wasn&#39;t going to go through the trouble of whitelisting my blog. I don&#39;t blame him, the advertising industry is to blame. With more people utilizing ad blockers, how would anyone get accurate analytics? I realized that I could utilize the middleware function in <a href="https://expressjs.com" title="The one and only, E X P R E S S">Express</a> to get my analytics. I may go deeper into my thought-process and inspiration for Chew at a later date but for now, you <a href="https://chew.sh" title="Just some analytics service I created">check it out</a> and use it in your own apps!</p>
<h3 id="what-now">What now?</h3>
<p>Getting your family, friends, and community onboard with what you&#39;ve just learned is an uphill battle. You can lead by example though, so <strong>do not feel discouraged</strong> if/when they don&#39;t care about the privacy implications of staying with <del>well</del>deceptively-designed services. We did not arrive at this clusterfuck of invasiveness and moral ambiguity overnight...it took some time and it will likely take some time to free ourselves from it.</p>
<p>Good luck. 🕸</p>

        <updated>2018-04-17T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want something done right...]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the almost two months since my last dispatch I moved my life from New England to Tennessee, started working on a new product, and learned of a couple other social networks in development. This might be a long read, make yourself comfortable.</p>
<h3 id="why-move">Why Move?</h3>
<p>The rent was too damn high! Also, with my skills I can work anywhere. Why not live in a place where the weather is (generally) better and the price of living is more agreeable?</p>
<h3 id="new-product">New Product</h3>
<p>While working on Socii, I made the conscious decision not to add an analytic script for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) <strong>I</strong> use ad blockers and it is safe to assume that the people who would join Socii do too. Therefore, my analytic script would be blocked. Why bother adding one in the first place?<br/>2) Gauges (the analytics provider for all my other sites) has been sold at least three times. They could get sold to Google or Facebook at some point and I am fundamentally opposed to using their products.</p>
<p>However, this became a hindrance at some point because Socii would error on a route and crash (unhandled promise rejections are bad!). I started thinking about having a service that could plug into my codebase with <strong>minimal change</strong> while also showing me where things happen.</p>
<p>Enter Chew (analytics you can count on)!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-04-a.png" alt="Homepage of Chew"/></p>
<p>It works by capturing the request object in your (Express 4) middleware and sending the relevant data to Chew. I spent a couple weeks working on this and it&#39;s <em>just about</em> ready for private testing (basically, me using it on my own sites and fixing bugs that occur). All you need to get started is a free Chew account and two lines of code in your Express-based app: importing the Chew npm package and a single line in your middleware.</p>
<p>As usual, I learned some things along the way and I look forward to applying these new learnings to Socii. I tend to refactor (and write more code comments) as I develop so I can help my future self when something needs fixing (or removal, I love when I can remove code).</p>
<p>Naturally, I used Socii as a base for Chew and came up with a very basic SaaS boilerplate:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-04-b.png" alt="My SaaS boilerplate, 1.0"/></p>
<p>The left side refers to self-explanatory services while the right side shows you the URLs each service would be reachable at.</p>
<p>The admin console is new to me and I haven&#39;t actually created one yet but I like the idea of a master interface being made available to admin users, instead of embedding admin controls inside the app. Separation of concerns, yes. More stuff to manage? Of course! The tradeoff is worth it to me.</p>
<p>Thanks to the power of Nginx and reverse proxies, you can run all of these on the same physical server! Probably shouldn&#39;t have the CDN there though. For Socii, I have a service that optimizes images before placing them in storage (DigitalOcean Spaces, their version of Amazon S3).</p>
<p>Once I have Chew launched and the notifications feature launched in Socii, I&#39;ll start working on open-sourcing my SaaS boilerplate. I just realized this is a great time to segue.</p>
<h3 id="social-networks">Social Networks</h3>
<p>I frequent HackerNews and commented on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16821172">a post</a> where someone listed their social network feature wishlist. Of course, I plugged Socii because it will match (most of) what they want when it is feature-complete. I fully expect downvotes and was pleasantly surprised to see the opposite occur! Furthermore, other people working on social networks reached out to me via LinkedIn and email. Unfortunately, aside from initial introductions I haven&#39;t conversed with these folks. I hope that changes soon, we could all learn from each other.</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that &quot;social&quot; is on the mind of everyone and I&#39;m glad that people are trying their hand at improving the Internet. 🕸</p>

        <updated>2018-02-24T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ship often!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been cranking out features and improvements over the past month. As I gear up for a major feature release, I&#39;d like to quickly run through what&#39;s in production now and what I&#39;ve learned since my last dispatch.</p>
<h3 id="top-8">Top 8</h3>
<p>From the ashes of Myspace comes a feature I&#39;ve missed dearly in every social network since. Why is this important to me? Well, sometimes I forget my friends&#39; usernames. I never forget a face. With Socii you can change your username whenever you want so for people you <em>really</em> want to keep in contact with (outside of real-life phone numbers and such), adding them to your top 8 is the way to go.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-03-a.jpg" alt="🎶 I&#39;m bringing Myspace back, yeah!"/></p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Three notable changes fall under this section.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://hub.socii.network/NetOpWibby/status/jdnns5gm000zhxbk97iymsgc" title="my post on Socii about the removal of the WebP decoder">I got rid of the WebP decoder</a> (and fixed an issue that arose on account of me doing too much in one commit). It was a bit slow in development which should have made me realize it&#39;d be MUCH too slow for production (even the WebAssembly-based/-compiled decoder I found wasn&#39;t good enough). Blink-based browsers (Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, &amp;c) were unaffected but Firefox and Safari suffered <em>greatly</em>. Personally, I use Firefox as my main browser so I felt this pain and <strong>hated</strong> it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-03-b.jpg" alt="Bye bye WebP...for now"/></p>
<p>Second, I implemented pagination. Prior to this, the hub (homepage of <a href="https://hub.socii.network" title="Socii, the social network">the actual network</a>, not <a href="https://socii.network" title="Socii, the marketing site for the social network">the marketing site</a>) was loading every. Single. Post. It was a friggin&#39; <em>mess</em> tbh. Now, I&#39;d like to have done this in my GraphQL service but I don&#39;t understand enough about it to implement cursor-based paging so the solution I came up with is kinda hacky. It works <em>for now</em> but I&#39;m on the lookout for tutorials or code samples that implement <strong>proper</strong> GraphQL pagination with <code>graphql.js</code> (even the official &quot;<a href="https://www.howtographql.com" title="How to GraphQL">how to</a>&quot; site is devoid of this information).</p>
<p>Finally, I created a custom script bundler to minify and combine front-end JavaScript so there would be far less render-blocking scripts to deal with. All the bundling frameworks like Rollup, Webpack, &amp;c, do too much while also not being flexible enough to do what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still working on improving performance. No one wants to visit a sluggish site, it&#39;s a waste of your time.</p>
<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3>
<p>You can now toggle between the global timeline and your top 8 timeline (well, if you&#39;ve <em>added</em> anyone to that list).</p>
<h3 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h3>
<p>As a front-end designer, it hurt me to publish something that didn&#39;t work well at smaller browser widths/breakpoints. I was <em>finally</em> able to get a <strong>lot</strong> of the stylistic things that were bothering me taken care of. Looking at these screenshots though, I gotta rethink the post footer. It looks too fat, I think both bits of info can fit on the same line.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-03-c.png" alt="Ooh, dat sweet responsive network"/></p>
<h3 id="things-ive-learned">Things I&#39;ve learned</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ship small features often. Not only do you get a sense of progression, but you can find issues quickly should you accidentally push errors into production.</li>
<li>Image uploading <del>in a <a href="http://boulter.com/blog/2004/08/19/performant-is-not-a-word" title="Performant is not a word">performant</a> way</del> that performs well with WebSockets is harder than I thought. I <em>think</em> I have something figured out but I have some non-Socii work to catch up on before I test my theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s all for now, see ya! 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PSA for frustrated Internet searchers]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When pushing <a href="https://hub.socii.network" title="Socii, the better social network">Socii</a> to production, I ran into a couple of problems and I&#39;m sharing them on my blog for you (learn from my mistakes!) and me (external memory source). This post will go over how I dealt with secure sessions not working out of the box with HTTPS.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with some code. I&#39;m using Feathers with Express but this code will still work sans Feathers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const app = express(feathers())
  // above removed for brevity

  // Initialize session and restore auth state
  .use(session({
    store: store,     // your session store of choice
    secret: secret,   // this should be an environment variable
    proxy: process.env.NODE_ENV !== &quot;development&quot;,
    resave: false,
    rolling: true,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: process.env.NODE_ENV !== &quot;development&quot;,
      path: &quot;/&quot;,
      maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 1 week
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV !== &quot;development&quot;
    }
  }))
;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>process.env.NODE_ENV !== &quot;development&quot;</code> is a clever shortcut I found while troubleshooting this issue. If <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> does not equal <code>development</code>, the result will be true in a production environment. In a development environment, the result would be false. This is assuming of course, that your development script sets the environment. Something like this in your <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  ...above removed for brevity

  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;npm run clean &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build-server&quot;,
    &quot;build-server&quot;: &quot;babel -d build server&quot;,
    &quot;clean&quot;: &quot;rm -rf build package-lock.json &amp;&amp; mkdir build&quot;,
    &quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;vagrant push&quot;,
    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;NODE_ENV=development nodemon server/index.js --ignore &#39;public/&#39; --exec babel-node --presets env,stage-2&quot;,
    &quot;sass&quot;: &quot;sass --watch sass:public/css --style compressed&quot;,
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;npm run build &amp;&amp; NODE_ENV=production node build/index.js&quot;,
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The scripts to pay attention are <code>dev</code> and <code>start</code>. You can see that I set the node environment before running my app. And there you have it, I hope you&#39;ve found this post helpful!</p>
<br/>

<p>Going back to the <code>express-session</code> code above, I list what most of the parameters mean:</p>

<p>Trust the reverse proxy when setting secure cookies (via the &quot;X-Forwarded-Proto&quot; header). The default value is undefined.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code> The &quot;X-Forwarded-Proto&quot; header will be used.</li>
<li><code>false</code> All headers are ignored and the connection is considered secure only if there is a direct TLS/SSL connection.</li>
<li><code>undefined</code> Uses the &quot;trust proxy&quot; setting from express</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resave">resave</h3>
<p>Forces the session to be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never modified during the request.</p>
<h3 id="rolling">rolling</h3>
<p>Force a session identifier cookie to be set on every response. The expiration is reset to the original maxAge, resetting the expiration countdown.</p>
<p>The default value is false.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> When this option is set to <code>true</code> but the <code>saveUninitialized</code> option is set to <code>false</code>, the cookie will not be set on a response with an uninitialized session.</p>
<h3 id="saveuninitialized">saveUninitialized</h3>
<p>Forces a session that is &quot;uninitialized&quot; to be saved to the store. A session is uninitialized when it is new but not modified.</p>
<h3 id="httponly">httpOnly</h3>
<p>Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTP(S), not client JavaScript, helping to protect against cross-site scripting attacks.</p>
<h3 id="secure">secure</h3>
<p>Ensures the browser only sends the cookie over HTTPS.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Launching is hard]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: Socii&#39;s <a href="https://hub.socii.network" title="Socii, the social network">alpha</a> is out in the wild and obviously <em>very</em> rough around the edges. Let me tell you what I&#39;ve learned since my last dispatch.</p>
<h3 id="graphql">GraphQL</h3>
<p>Yours truly, <a href="/2018/socii-dispatch-01" title="Socii Dispatch 01">two weeks ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://graphql.org" title="Official website for GraphQL">GraphQL</a> is awesome. However, I&#39;ve been building REST APIs for the past month and have two microservices to handle things thus far <em>and that means</em> I&#39;m not transitioning to GraphQL until maybe version 1 of Socii is solidified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HAH. Mere <em>days</em> after I published those words, I ran into an issue where I needed to display comments and for those comments to show pertinent info like:</p>
<ul>
<li>author&#39;s<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>username</li>
<li>avatar shape</li>
<li>avatar source</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I stuck with REST, here&#39;s what my query path would&#39;ve looked like:</p>
<ul>
<li>query story service for original post (already have user info from earlier query)</li>
<li>query story service for comments to the original post<ul>
<li>for each comment, query user service for comment author&#39;s aforementioned info</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is way too much work to get four pieces of info for a comment. Keep in mind that I&#39;d get the <em>entire</em> user object with each query to the user service as well. Here&#39;s how I achieved this with GraphQL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const query = `{
  post(replyTo: &quot;${postId}&quot;) {
    author
    content
    createdAt
    id
    favoritedBy
    notes {
      favorites
      replies
      reposts
    }
    repliedBy
    replyTo
    repostedBy
    slug
  }
}`;</code></pre>
<p>Couple things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li>GraphQL pros will tell me to use variables instead of what I&#39;m doing here with <code>postId</code> in a template literal but MEH.</li>
<li>The <code>author</code> parameter does a little extra stuff on my GraphQL service to reply back with name, username, and avatar info.</li>
<li>The post schema is quite large but I don&#39;t need all of it to display them. What you see in this query is what I get back. No wasted data, how neat is that?</li>
</ol>
<p>This took me around three days to fully grok and to be quite honest, I am not really sure if I do. 😅 It works though!</p>
<p>There are <em>several</em> articles and dissertations out there with a clickbait-y title bemoaning the demise of REST thanks to GraphQL and well...no. REST is battle-tested and still pretty damn good. In fact, I&#39;m still using it for anything that isn&#39;t a <code>GET</code> request. When you&#39;re <code>POST</code>ing or <code>PUT</code>ing, I think REST reigns supreme and quite frankly, I don&#39;t feel like rewriting that code.</p>
<p>Let me have a year with ol&#39; graphy before I do something crazy.</p>
<h3 id="webp">WebP</h3>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp" title="Official website for WebP">WebP</a> is an image format invented by Google as an alternative to JPG and PNG for small (but visually comparable) images. I like the idea of paying almost nothing for image storage so my interest was piqued early in Socii&#39;s development.</p>
<p>The cost savings I&#39;ve seen during testing have been massive. I had two folders named &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;processed&quot;. After converting 10 or so large images (screenshots and the like), the &quot;raw&quot; folder was ~5MB while the &quot;processed&quot; folder was ~1MB. At scale, that&#39;s some impressive cost savings. The visual parity was indistinguishable to me as well.</p>
<p>Of course, Chrome is the only browser that natively <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=webp" title="Support table for WebP">supports</a> it. I found a polyfill that works for non-Chrome users (like myself, Firefox is best for me) and I thought it&#39;d be usable in production. It is <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>I am now reversing my decision to use WebP exclusively and will optimize images uploaded to Socii. Decoding WebP in the browser is slow, even with the WebAssembly-converted polyfill and scrolling is horrendous. That&#39;s <em>terrible</em> user experience. I found another image format called <a href="https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF" title="Free Lossless Image Format on GitHub">FLIF</a> but the current polyfills are also not production-ready.</p>
<h3 id="things-ive-learned">Things I&#39;ve learned</h3>
<ol>
<li>Estimates are dumb because people are dumb. Even if you account for that, you&#39;ll still be off.</li>
<li>GraphQL is still awesome. I&#39;m glad it took up my estimate time to learn it.</li>
<li>We need better image formats on the web and browser vendors need to get onboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s all for now, see ya! 🕸</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2018/nginx-and-socketio"/>
        <updated>2018-02-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two of my favorite web technologies, together]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When pushing <a href="https://hub.socii.network" title="Socii, the better social network">Socii</a> to production, I forgot how to account for the fact that <a href="https://socket.io" title="Real-time websocket engine">Socket.io</a> will not work out of the box with HTTPS without a lil&#39; extra configuration.</p>
<p>On your nginx server, you&#39;ll want to edit your <code>default</code> file located at <code>etc</code> &gt; <code>nginx</code> &gt; <code>sites-available</code>. I&#39;ll use one of my server blocks as an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nginx">server {
  # removed for brevity

  location ~* \.io {
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host             $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy    true;
    proxy_pass                        http://localhost:1234;
    proxy_redirect                    off;
    proxy_http_version                1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade          $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection       &quot;upgrade&quot;;

    proxy_redirect                    off;
    proxy_set_header                  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_cache_key                   sfs$request_uri$scheme;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>proxy_pass</code> value will be the same as your app&#39;s. Actually, the entire location directive is exactly the same, except for the opening <code>location</code> bit. So, in the section that was removed for brevity you&#39;d have the same <code>location</code> block as above but <code>location ~* \.io</code> would be replaced with <code>location /</code>.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;re done editing, SSH into your server and run <code>nginx -t</code> to ensure your configuration syntax is solid. Your changes won&#39;t be applied until the nginx service (or your server) restarts and if you configured something incorrectly, you don&#39;t want that to happen. If you get a message saying the syntax is okay, run <code>service nginx restart</code> and you&#39;re good to go!</p>
<p>This is something I do once or twice a year and am stumped by so this blog post is serving as an external memory unit. Hope this helps you as well! 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Updates with Socii's development]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past month I&#39;ve been hard at work, developing basic social network features. Namely, account and post creation and editing your profile. To be honest, it&#39;s not glamorous work but I&#39;ve been having a blast doing it. Here&#39;s what&#39;s been completed thus far.</p>
<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-01-a.jpg" alt="First look at your profile"/></p>
<p>On your profile, you&#39;ll see your avatar in whatever shape you choose from available options which are a triangle (the default), circle (classic), square (old-school), diamond, and inverted triangle. Below your avatar in the first sidebar, you&#39;ll find your name and username.</p>
<p>When you sign up for Socii, you&#39;re automatically logged in and given a generated username based on your email address so feel free to change it if something like <code>paul927465</code> doesn&#39;t quite fit you. Anecdotally, I&#39;ve noticed that as people go through life changes they tend to want user/name changes as well so I&#39;ve made Socii unreliant on usernames on the back-end. Friends and followers would want to know if you go from <code>SuperAwesomeMegaTon</code> to <code>netop://~tonton</code> and I&#39;m building a notification system to accommodate that.</p>
<p>There are currently no limits on username changes and I can conceivably see how harassment could occur with it. You&#39;ll be equipped with proper muting and blocking tools should you unwittingly connect with an annoying person.</p>
<p>In the other sidebar, you&#39;ll see something called &quot;top 8&quot;. Older readers will remember the <em>glory</em> that was MySpace and I wanted to bring that back as I found it useful.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just want to visit a friend&#39;s page and I forget what their username is (and, if you follow a lot of people who post more often than your friend(s), you&#39;ll miss their posts). I sure know what my friends <strong>look</strong> like though and it&#39;ll be pretty sweet to see which shapes they choose for their avatars.</p>
<p>And of course you&#39;ll find your personal stream of posts. Within each post block is a menu indicator that contains actions for editing your post, quick copying of the direct link to the post, pinning the post to your profile, and deleting the post. If you want to like your own post for some reason, you can definitely do that. You can also create threads by responding to your own posts.</p>
<h3 id="post-creation">Post creation</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-01-b.jpg" alt="Post creator, clean"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-01-c.jpg" alt="Post creator with a code snippet"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-01-d.jpg" alt="That rendered code snippet...wish it had color"/></p>
<p>Socii supports Markdown! I&#39;m using a customized version of <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown" title="Showdown repo on GitHub">Showdown</a> to enable it. The eye icon in the footer of the post creator allows for previewing what your post will look like when it&#39;s live. The character limit is 150 for reasons that will become apparent in a couple months, after I ship a major (secret) feature.</p>
<p>However, your post can be up to <strong>5,000 characters</strong> long if you so choose! 😰 That&#39;d be <em>extremely</em> annoying to attempt scrolling in a feed so posts longer than 150 characters will be truncated by default with a button to expand it should anyone want to read the entire thing. The question mark icon will give you quick tips on how to use Markdown to add a bit of flavor to your posts.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to read a long post but don&#39;t have time at the moment, you can save that post for future reading.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018/socii-dispatch-01-e.jpg" alt="Respond to your own post to create a thread"/></p>
<p>For the moment, only one post status type is available and that is &quot;publish&quot;. Forthcoming updates will bring three more: drafts, queues, and schedule. Similarly, the only post creator mode available is &quot;text&quot; but future updates will bring photo, audio, and video options.</p>
<h3 id="in-progress">In progress</h3>
<p>There&#39;s still a good amount of work to get done. For starters, there&#39;s no way for you to change your avatar and that&#39;s the <em>first</em> thing I do when joining a new service. I also want to get notifications and the global/top 8 feeds working. I think being able to toggle between what everyone is talking about versus whomever in your top 8 is talking about will be neat.</p>
<p>I want to be more open about developing Socii for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want this social network to be good for people.</li>
<li>I develop in a vacuum and while I share updates with a couple people IRL, I think other people could benefit from what I&#39;m learning in the process.</li>
<li>External reminder of what I have accomplished. Most people can agree that we accomplish things but beat ourselves up for that <em>one</em> thing we didn&#39;t do. That&#39;s demoralizing and I don&#39;t want to stop before Socii gets into people&#39;s hands.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, I&#39;m making a new commitment to releasing Socii at the end of this month for alpha access to members of my mailing list. If you haven&#39;t joined yet, you can find it at <a href="https://socii.network/welcome" title="Mailing list for Socii">socii.network</a>. For more information about Socii, you can <a href="/2017/who-creates-social-networks" title="Who the hell creates a social network?">read this post</a> or check out the manifesto on Socii&#39;s official marketing page.</p>
<h3 id="things-ive-learned">Things I&#39;ve learned</h3>
<p>I figured it&#39;d be a good idea to share what I&#39;ve learned since my last blog post about Socii:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;m tired of rounded corners everywhere. I&#39;ve removed <code>border-radius</code> from all the Sass files.</li>
<li>GraphQL is awesome. However, I&#39;ve been building REST APIs for the past month and have two microservices to handle things thus far <em>and that means</em> I&#39;m not transitioning to GraphQL until maybe version 1 of Socii is solidified. 😤 Wish I learned of it sooner (it&#39;s basically a better way to do REST and talk to servers).</li>
<li>Styling with <code>:root</code>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root" title="MDN article on :root styling">This</a> is how everyone will have customized profile pages. I don&#39;t know why every example I&#39;ve seen it used has root styles overriding each other. I try to write my CSS in a way that doesn&#39;t have style overrides because it&#39;s a hassle to deal with. If you have <code>:root.user</code> styling, just have <code>:root:not(.user)</code> for your default styling. Easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s all for now, see ya! 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's not your fault]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been unemployed since November 1st, <em>four days</em> after my wedding. The company I was working for went out of business for various reasons I won&#39;t get into but at least I got one last paycheck! This was the first time in my life that I&#39;d been let go from a job. I&#39;d either leave on my own accord or be fired (this only happened twice, once in my professional career). I went into this new development in my life fairly non-plussed because I&#39;ve <em>always</em> been able to find work relatively quickly. Of course, life has a way of reminding you not to get comfortable. <em>Hooray</em>.</p>
<h3 id="rounds-of-interviews">Rounds of interviews</h3>
<p>Lots and <strong>lots</strong> of rounds. I really don&#39;t understand why this is necessary. Here&#39;s what what makes sense to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phone screen</li>
<li>Tech screen</li>
<li>Meet the team</li>
</ol>
<p>After this, shouldn&#39;t you <em>know</em> if you want to work with someone or not? What&#39;s wrong with your process that you need <em>more</em> than three steps? Last month, I ran an interview <em>gauntlet</em> with a company I (previously) admired. I had a video interview with HR and a phone interview with <em>another</em> person from HR days later. Then, I had to clear my entire Friday from <strong>9am to 6pm</strong> for <em>five</em> video interviews with the shortest one being 45 minutes. I thought I aced it! I even wrote a tutorial on how to use one of their products and integrated said product into some of my projects. I was told that I&#39;d hear back from someone in a few days and if not, to email.</p>
<p>Stop me if you&#39;ve heard this before.</p>
<p>I waited. Emailed. Waited. Emailed again. By this point, another week passed and I was <em>pissed</em>. I even checked my mail server to see if messages were lost in the ether. <strong>Nothing</strong>.</p>
<p>Companies don&#39;t seem to realize that every interview is an investment of time and emotion for the applicant. I apply for positions where I feel I can make a positive impact and work on an awesome product or help an idea form and gain traction. <strong>There is no excuse for not communicating.</strong> While these companies are internally deciding who to vet next, they can at least send a templated reply back. I don&#39;t care if it looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Paul, Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha NO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least I know not to waste my time waiting on you.</p>
<h3 id="codingdesign-tests">Coding/design tests</h3>
<p>See also: whiteboarding.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve <em>never</em> met someone who performs exceptionally well with thinking on the spot in front of people they&#39;ve never met when the grand prize is gainful employment. Not only are you thinking about whatever question you&#39;ve been asked to demonstrate your thought process on, you&#39;re also thinking about what they might want to see. Do you have your back turned too much? Should you over-explain to &quot;prove&quot; you fundamentally understand the concept(s)? What happens if you don&#39;t understand the question? Do they take &quot;points&quot; off for that?</p>
<p>That shit is incredibly stressful.</p>
<p>You know what I love about coding tests? Finding a use for one-off code exercises in my own work so I feel like my time wasn&#39;t completely wasted. You know what else I love about them? Absolutely nothing. These <strong>tests and whiteboarding are not indicative of your skill level</strong>, they are <em>approximations</em> of what you can do with what is likely to be limited information and ambiguous scope.</p>
<p>Assuming you are gainfully employed, dear reader, think about your job today: you (typically) aren&#39;t asked to create a solution for something with three bullet points in a README file with a section for &quot;extra credit ;)&quot;.</p>
<p>I recently did one of these tests and yes, I&#39;ve identified a portion of the code I wrote for integration in one of my projects. After days of waiting to hear yay or nay, I decided to email a few hours ago and was told other people had more impressive code submissions and tech stack cohesion. Makes sense but, would I have gotten that rejection email today if I hadn&#39;t checked in? Next week? Next month? In my experience, I either don&#39;t get that email until at least two weeks later at the earliest, if ever.</p>
<p>Segue!</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>It&#39;s very rare that you&#39;ll get helpful emails on how you can improve your chances in interviews from the very companies that rejected you, especially if you ask for it. This is at odds with the initial tone and type of communication that&#39;s exchanged when figuring out if you two are a good fit. &quot;Other candidates were a better fit, feel free to apply again in the future.&quot; Um, okay, but why would I do that when <em>I don&#39;t know why I wasn&#39;t a fit to begin with</em>? I view these canned statements as passive aggressive and make a note of avoiding the company and their products going forward.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deal">How to deal</h3>
<p>Depends on the person.</p>
<p>For me, open world video games are a great outlet for expending frustration and allows me to cool down. I also enjoy writing and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve written this post. Having my time wasted is one of my chief pet peeves and it&#39;s an unavoidable part of the job search...falling in love with a product and/or company only to later be rejected, dismissed, and ignored is a <strong>soul-crushing</strong> exercise, one that we subject ourselves to because we quite literally don&#39;t have a choice.</p>
<p>It fucking sucks.</p>
<p>I was at a seminar today about dealing with stress in the job search and I heard from people over the age of 40 expressing their experiences and frustration with age bias. They do well with initial email contact and phone interviews but when it&#39;s time for the in-person interview, they see and feel quite accurately that their age is what prevents them from moving forward in the process. I feel bad for these people because their only enemy is time. Rather than hire the best, some companies look to hire recent graduates so they can 1) be overworked and 2) offered less pay. They don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know and certainly won&#39;t ask questions. Older people and those with experience would never put up with that.</p>
<p>In the seminar we were told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are not at fault for being in the situation you are in.</strong> External forces changed your lives in a (mostly) negative way but, it&#39;s up to you to deal with it in a productive way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever tried guided meditation? It was the first time my brain was silent outside of sleep...it was weird. I almost fell asleep, haha! I&#39;m going to try practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness" title="Wikipedia entry about &#39;Mindfulness&#39;">mindfulness</a> more.</p>
<h3 id="upsides">Upsides?</h3>
<p>Losing my job and not finding a new one shortly after has awarded me something that&#39;s been lacking in me for quite some time, and that is <strong>focus</strong>. As I mentioned in <a href="/2017/year-in-review" title="Year in Review">my last post</a>, I put a stop to all but one of my projects and am focusing on just <a href="/2017/who-creates-social-networks" title="Who the hell creates a social network?">one</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing my year-old child grow and learning new words, colors, and numbers has been a fascinating experience. He&#39;ll randomly point at something and say whatever he&#39;s looking at: &quot;Red! Nine! A! Lellow!&quot; (Yellow) and so on. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>Constantly retelling my employment history has encouraged me to shorten my &quot;elevator pitch&quot; so I can at least get that part of the conversation over and done with quickly. My cover letter has seen <em>many</em> shifts and improvements. I state upfront that I have zero React experience because 99.999999% of tech companies want someone with 18 years of experience with a four-year-old JavaScript framework. I&#39;m being facetious here but that requirement is <em>ridiculous</em> for a fad. Writing CSS in JS? <em>GROSS</em>.</p>
<p>I redesigned my resume to put my skills upfront (responsive front-end web design and development, yes I can design <em>and</em> code), followed by projects that utilize those skills, and then experience. As tired as I am of the bullshit companies put you through in the hiring process, I&#39;m sure companies deal with all sorts of other bullshit too. I like to think my cover letter and resume do a very good job of informing potential employers if I&#39;m a good tech fit. If not, no need to respond! Just keep it moving. Getting me invested in the conversation, your company and product, and then ignoring me?</p>
<p><em>Maaaaan</em>, go <strong>fuck</strong> yourself. 🕸</p>
<p><br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>P.S. When I eventually hire people for my own company I&#39;m reading this post every week to remind myself that applicants aren&#39;t just numbers or Post-Its on a board, they are people with feelings and expectations that they will be replied to in a timely manner because they have life and responsibilities to deal with.</p>
<p>P.P.S. This post has garnered more interest than I thought it would on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16127697" title="Conversation on HackerNews about this post">HackerNews</a>. You can read varying viewpoints ranging from those who&#39;ve been in this situation and are employers doing MUCH better than the ones I&#39;ve outlined in this post, to people who are just plain dismissive of myself and others like me. It&#39;s a pretty good read regardless, I love discourse.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoo boy, what a year]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Keeping with the tradition of reviewing my year, let&#39;s have a look back at my 2017.</p>
<h3 id="i-visited-japan">I visited Japan</h3>
<p>My buddy Jamar had the bright idea to order plane tickets to Japan in December of last year for September of this year. Of course, I paid him back within the first four months of 2017. Anyhoo, we stayed for two weeks (my other buddy Oliver stayed for a week) and it was one of <em>the</em> best experiences of my life. Holy moly. I still have a LOT of footage to get through. I&#39;ve been meaning to post about my trip for quite some time but 60GB+ is too much to go through...or maybe I&#39;m just lazy. Here&#39;s a couple pics to whet your appetite:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-a.jpg" alt="Japanese money!"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-b.jpg" alt="I finally understand the significance of 7-11"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-c.jpg" alt="SQUAAAAAD!"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-d.jpg" alt="Nighttime Marauders"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-e.jpg" alt="The only train delay I experienced and it was for five minutes"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-f.jpg" alt="Rainy day in Tokyo"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-g.jpg" alt="I found a dope spot for us to take pics"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-h.jpg" alt="Cloud seeker"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-i.jpg" alt="Shrimp curry at Mt Fuji"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-j.jpg" alt="24 hours? Crazy"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-k.jpg" alt="One of many train station shots"/></p>
<h3 id="i-proposed-and-got-married">I proposed and got married</h3>
<p>During Easter I proposed to my longtime girlfriend and although we planned an semi-elaborate wedding, we decided to make it a small get-together. After all, we were financing things ourselves so it made the most sense. This was another great experience, especially because the weather leading up to and immediately after our wedding day was absolutely <em>dreadful</em> and cold. We took that as a sign of the universe approving our union.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-l.jpg" alt="Marriage in autumn"/></p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning how we met, you can check out both <a href="http://sincerelyshantelle.com/blog/how-i-met-my-husband" title="How my wife met me">her post</a> and <a href="/2017/how-i-met-my-wife" title="How I met my wife">mine</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i-lost-my-job">I lost my job</h3>
<p>The startup I was working for went out of business in November. This was a mere <em>four days</em> after my wedding. 🤬 Yeah I know, fun right? Christmas a month later too? <strong>Good grief</strong>! Studies show that money is one of the major reasons behind divorce so I guess my wife and I were lucky that this happened immediately. Even though job searching is immensely stressful (and annoying), having ample time to work on projects I reserved for nights and weekends has been a plus.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to you: if you work for a startup that&#39;s focused <em>solely</em> on B2B and they poo-poo the idea of B2C for additional revenue even though their big partners are moving slower than molasses, <em>flee as soon as you can</em>. That big partner can <strong>and will</strong> outlive your dinky startup.</p>
<h3 id="became-more-productive">Became more productive</h3>
<p>This was a direct result of losing my job. Per my post about <a href="/2017/neglected-projects" title="A post about my neglected projects">neglected projects</a>, I went through the list and either redesigned or sunset them. My sunset&#39;d projects aren&#39;t 100% gone, just positioned in a way that I don&#39;t feel bad about seeing them. A great way to ensure that is to get your project(s) to a nice stopping point <em>and</em> leave yourself notes.</p>
<p>With those out of the way, I started work on a social network called Socii. You can <a href="/2017/who-creates-social-networks" title="Who creates social networks?">read more about</a> it or <a href="https://socii.network" title="Socii, the social network">visit the site</a> to sign up for updates!</p>
<h3 id="fin">FIN</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s my top nine Instagram photos, based on likes.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/year-in-review-m.jpg" alt="Top nine Instagram pics of 2017"/></p>
<p>This may be the last time I do one of these, I want Socii to replace Instagram for me. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A crazy person, that's who.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Or, &quot;Social networks are terrible, so I&#39;m creating one&quot;. But...why? <em>Excellent</em> question, buckle up gang!</p>
<p>Social networks in 2017 are just <strong>bad</strong>. There&#39;s no shortage of articles written about how depressing, manipulative, greedy, and morally bankrupt they are but, to what end? The same people writing about these horrid networks continue to use them because <em>despite</em> all the horrible things done (or ignored) by the creators to their users, these networks have <em>utility</em>. At their very core, social networks bring people together and double as support groups for like-minded thinkers (for better or worse). There&#39;s (seemingly) no incentive for the networks to make things better on behalf of their users. Where else are they (the masses) gonna go? Mastodon? Micro.blog? Sublevel? Scuttlebutt? HAH!</p>
<p>&quot;Big Social&quot; knows <em>damn well</em> that the average user (read: at least 70% of them) isn&#39;t going to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a DigitalOcean, or other VPS (virtual private server) provider account</li>
<li>Pay <strong>money</strong> for a server (even though the cheapest is $5)</li>
<li>Read a tutorial on GitHub for instructions on how to set up their own Mastodon instance</li>
<li>Invite their friends and family</li>
<li>Maintain the server and <strong>continue</strong> paying $5/month for it</li>
</ol>
<p>You wanna know what my friends did after I told them I was deleting my Facebook account at the top of this year? Some responded with a disaffected, &quot;oh&quot;. Some were appalled at the privacy violations they unknowingly subjected themselves to daily yet continued scrolling their feed. Others just didn&#39;t care. Now we get to the reason social networks are just <em>bad</em> and will continue to be: The masses simply do not give a rat&#39;s ass, flying fuck, and/or shit. <em>Womp womp</em>.</p>
<p>To my wife&#39;s credit, she mainly uses Facebook for the mom/support groups she&#39;s found. All those moms aren&#39;t going to a transition to a Discord server or subreddit because the <em>experience</em> will be too jarring and that&#39;ll make the transition unlikely to stick.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, <strong>I am not much better</strong>. I mean sure, I quit Google because of their ever-increasing invasiveness to my privacy and selling my user data to advertisers. I now self-host my email (shout out to <a href="https://mailinabox.email" title="Take back control of your email">Mail-in-a-Box</a>). But...I created a new Google account so I could still use YouTube (thinking about deleting it again and manually keeping track of favorite channels but MEHHHHH).</p>
<p>I complain about Twitter <strong>on</strong> Twitter and guess what? I tweet like a <em>mofo</em>. I retweet even more! I favorite! I am <strong>disgusted</strong> by the fact that they utilize Drumpf in their advertisements overseas while pretending that they cannot hold the current U.S. president to the same standards as everyone else. I am disgusted by the way they <em>enable</em> Nazi propaganda while simultaneously blocking such content in Germany and France. I am disgusted by the way they effectively <strong>shit</strong> on their users being attacked and for some strange reason, <em>side with the oppressors/attackers</em>. And yet...it&#39;s <em>the best damn version of social media I&#39;ve been on to date</em> and that does <strong>not</strong> make me happy. At some point though, you&#39;ve got to stop complaining and <strong>take action</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/who-creates-social-networks-a.jpg" alt="Socii logo and logotype"/></p>
<p>Introducing <strong>Socii</strong> (&quot;Oh great, another social network,&quot; you think), my answer to the bullshit perpetuated by Big Social and the absence of an easily accessible alternative (pronounced \&#39;sō-&#39;kē\).</p>
<p>Like Big Social, you&#39;ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>add a profile picture</li>
<li>have an accent color</li>
<li>post updates</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Un</em>like Big Social, you&#39;ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>play with a crap ton more customization options (top secret for now)</li>
<li>use tools to customize and protect your online experience</li>
<li>read your timeline untouched by algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;This sounds good,&quot; you say, &quot;but how will you make money? I&#39;m not paying for a social network!&quot;</p>
<p>Well damn, you&#39;re stingy but okay <em>I get it</em>. There will be a merchandise shop, account upgrades like the ability to secure a three/four character username, and something else related to the top secret customization options mentioned above. Furthermore, there will be a way for users to make a bit of cash themselves. It is my hope that this will be enough to keep Socii going once the free tier limits on some services I&#39;m using to operate it start costing money.</p>
<p>To temper expectations (if only for myself), I do not expect Socii to become &quot;the one true network&quot; but I would be <strong>delighted</strong> if people found it to be a welcome reprieve and community of good vibes. A private alpha will occur in early 2018 with a beta slated for (hopefully) late summer. I&#39;ll bring people in on a rolling basis at that point. If you&#39;d like to be notified once early registration opens up, feel free to sign up at <a href="https://socii.network/welcome" title="Join Socii, the social network">socii.network</a>! 🕸</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2017/easy-deployment-with-vagrant"/>
        <updated>2017-12-05T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quite irritated I wasn't doing this already]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com" title="Vagrant website">Vagrant</a> provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is fine and dandy but, I&#39;m not on a team with my side projects. I just want to <em>quickly push my code to a server and keep it moving</em>. Here&#39;s how I did it.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Head on over to HashiCorp&#39;s <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" title="Download Vagrant...to install it!">download page for Vagrant</a> and select the build for your OS flavor of choice. After the installation is complete, open a Terminal and type <code>vagrant -v</code> to ensure installation was successful. If you see a version number, you&#39;re good to go.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p><code>cd</code> into the folder you want to deploy and initialize a Vagrant deployment script with <code>vagrant init</code>. This will automatically generate a <code>Vagrantfile</code> and it is in here that you&#39;ll customize your deployment strategies. <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/push/ftp.html" title="FTP/SFTP deployment strategy documentation for Vagrant">Here</a> are all the parameters you can use for SFTP (which is the way I&#39;m deploying my projects). There&#39;s documentation for Heroku and inline scripts as well. Here&#39;s my deployment script for <code>thewebb.blog</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.box = &quot;base&quot;

  config.push.define &quot;ftp&quot; do |push|
    push.host = &quot;thewebb.blog&quot;
    push.username = &quot;root&quot;
    push.password = &quot;~/.ssh/id_rsa&quot;
    push.secure = true
    push.destination = &quot;/var/www/twb&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;.DS_Store&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;.git&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;.gitignore&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;.sass-cache&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;[documents]&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;node_modules&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;package-lock.json&quot;
    push.exclude = &quot;Vagrantfile&quot;
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>You can probably guess what&#39;s going on here, but I&#39;ll walk you through it anyway.</p>
<p>I&#39;m connected to <code>thewebb.blog</code> via secure FTP, or SFTP, with an SSH key (because passwords are lame). The directory I want to push data to on <code>thewebb.blog</code> has a path of <code>/var/www/twb</code>. There are a couple of files and folders I don&#39;t want/need on my server (mostly the contents of my <code>.gitignore</code>, along with that file itself).</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/index.html" title="Vagrant documentation">the documentation</a> for in-depth descriptions about other parameters like <code>config.vm.box</code> (this line is required btw).</p>
<h3 id="takeoff">Takeoff</h3>
<p>I use Node.js for practically everything I do so I added a nifty deploy command to my <code>package.json</code>. Here&#39;s the relevant bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;vagrant push&quot;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s it!</p>
<p>To be quite honest, me using Vagrant feels like the equivalent of buying an iMac Pro to browse the Internet but, their tagline is &quot;Deployment environments made easy&quot;. And guess what? It works <em>damn good</em>. What&#39;s easier than <code>npm run deploy</code>?</p>
<h3 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h3>
<p>When you deploy your project, you&#39;ll see a message in Terminal stating what&#39;s happening, but nothing else. It would be <em>nice</em> to have a progress bar to indicate...well, progress but it doesn&#39;t take too long (for my projects). Also, automatic reading of my <code>.gitignore</code> file so I don&#39;t have to manually include what I want excluded.</p>
<p>Another thing that would be nice is something where my server could detect changes and run commands. For example, let&#39;s say I add new modules to this blog. I&#39;ll have to install them on my server as well. Currently, I have to SSH into it and run whatever extra steps to ensure updates and I <em>reeeeeally</em> don&#39;t feel like doing that. You could argue that I could just use HashiCorp&#39;s other tools like Nomad and Consul but 1) it was too confusing to set up and I realized 2) those tools are <strong>definitely</strong> overkill for what I work on.</p>
<p>SO! I have caused myself <strong>much</strong> pain to create a system that allows these automatic updates to happen. Just deploy and your server will take care of the rest. During my failed attempts at utilizing other tools, I was inspired by the ease with which I deployed with Vagrant via a simple file. It&#39;s still in development but I&#39;ve been working on it for the past day and a half. Great progress has been made, stay tuned! 🕸</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review"/>
        <updated>2017-11-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behold, my first media review!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><strong>The 6500mAh portable battery case specially design[ed] for Nintendo Switch...will double the playing time wherever you are.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what it says on the box anyway. Does it live up to it&#39;s lofty goal? Read on to find out!</p>
<h3 id="aesthetic">Aesthetic</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-a.jpg" alt="Front of case"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-b.jpg" alt="Back of case"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-c.jpg" alt="Back of case, open"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-d.jpg" alt="Game compartment on the back"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-e.jpg" alt="Recline level I"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-f.jpg" alt="Recline level II"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-g.jpg" alt="Recline level III"/></p>
<p>The outside of the case has a matte finish that feels <em>quite</em> good. The back has two release mechanisms that expand the case vertically to allow insertion of your Switch. Below both mechanisms are kickstands with three levels of recline. I only used them while testing as I prefer to use handheld mode on the go. There certainly isn&#39;t any space for kickstand mode on the MBTA! Near the bottom of the case are holes for the Switch&#39;s heat vents and a power button followed by four thunderbolts to signify how much charge is available. They alight blue when charging. The top of the case hides a compartment for storing two Switch games horizontally. The side of the case features USB-C charging. YUS!</p>
<h3 id="portability">Portability</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-h.jpg" alt="Side of case with Switch"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-i.jpg" alt="Back of case with Switch"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-j.jpg" alt="Top of case with Switch"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-k.jpg" alt="Detached Joy-Con with cased Switch"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-l.jpg" alt="Fanny pack view I"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-m.jpg" alt="Fanny pack view II"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/antank-case-for-nintendo-switch-review-n.jpg" alt="Slipcases are a no-go with the case"/></p>
<p>The case by itself doesn&#39;t weigh much but when you insert the Switch, you can <strong>definitely</strong> notice the difference (if you play in handheld mode often). I was able to squeeze my Switch and case inside a fanny pack but it was a tight fit. Don&#39;t expect this to work with your nifty Super Mario Odyssey slipcase, that ain&#39;t happening. <em>Of course</em>, you could always store the battery case itself in the drawstring bag that comes with it.</p>
<h3 id="real-world-usage">Real-world Usage</h3>
<p>I didn&#39;t measure the charge time for the case itself but it&#39;s roughly an hour and a half to two hours. I used my MacBook Pro power brick to charge so I&#39;m not sure if that made a difference versus the default power brick it comes with. During my playtest with Super Mario Odyssey, I noticed the case didn&#39;t recharge my Switch...it basically kept it from dying and was effectively a portable wall-charger. I assume graphically-intensive games prevent charging AND battery replenishment so that was a little discouraging. I got <em>at least</em> a half-hour of extended playtime thanks to this charger though and that&#39;s what counts.</p>
<h3 id="should-you-buy-this">Should you buy this?</h3>
<p>If you play your Switch a LOT while nowhere near a USB-C charger, absolutely. I can see this being a <strong>great</strong> addition to any traveler as well. I wish I had this with me in Japan for the bullet train rides, I was using the available socket to me for charging my computer. Also, China Southern Airlines did not have appropriate sockets for me to charge my computer. Instead of sleeping to pass the time, I could&#39;ve been playing Mr Shifty or Zelda.</p>
<p>Even for occasional travel, having a Switch charger that envelopes the system is a great idea. I have an Anker USB-C charger and it&#39;s a brick. <em>Sure</em>, I can charge my Switch with it but it&#39;s <em>unwieldy</em> and it <strong>sucks</strong> dealing with cables. I&#39;m loving the one port life with as little cables as possible and Antank made that a little bit bearable. You can buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Battery-Charger-Portable-6500mAh-Extended/dp/B07314ZP7L" title="Antank portable battery charger for Nintendo Switch on Amazon">Antank charger on Amazon</a> for $47.</p>
<p>If you have an existing USB-C charger and don&#39;t care about having a case that fits your Switch, there is absolutely no need to get this. It&#39;s more of a convenience thing, not a necessity. 🕸</p>
<h3 id="ps">P.S.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was approached by a representative for Antank to purchase and review their charger. I was refunded after purchasing.</li>
<li>It occurs to me that I never tested how much the case would recharge my Switch while it was turned <em>off</em>. I&#39;ll get on that and update this post.</li>

<p>Anyhoo, I was looking forward to its return so I could make games for the Switch using my existing skillset. Due to Nintendo&#39;s enthusiasm for the Unity and Unreal game engines, it doesn&#39;t seem like that&#39;s happening anytime soon if ever, much to the chagrin of aspiring game developers (and Switch owners) like myself. However, I was curious to know what the built-in browser is capable of. Here&#39;s <a href="http://html5test.com/s/21ae2339d0366534.html" title="Nintendo Switch browser HTML5 test">what I found</a>, with my Switch&#39;s OS on version <code>4.0.1</code>:</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch browser scored 339 out of 555 potential points. Not bad for browsing but it <em>certainly</em> isn&#39;t equipped for game development. Lack of support for WebGL, WebM, the Web Animations API, and IndexedDB certainly inhibits the kinds of games you could make, so this might explain their silence on the NWF front.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>If you have a Switch and want to see these results for yourself, here are the steps needed to access the web browser:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <code>System Settings</code> &gt; <code>Internet</code> &gt; <code>Internet Settings</code></li>
<li>Select the network you want to join or are already connected to</li>
<li>Select <code>Change Settings</code></li>
<li>Select <code>DNS Settings</code> and choose <code>Manual</code></li>
<li>Under <code>DNS Settings</code>, select <code>Primary DNS</code></li>
<li>Replace the contents with <code>045.055.142.122</code> and hit <code>OK</code></li>
<li>Save!</li>
<li>Connect to the network you just modified DNS settings for, and you should see a message saying &quot;Registration is required to use this network&quot;</li>
<li>Proceed and you&#39;ll be redirected to Google, where you can search for DuckDuckGo and use that search engine instead</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="extra-stuff">Extra stuff</h3>
<p>The useragent Nintendo is going with is <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo Switch; WifiWebAuthApplet) AppleWebKit/601.6 (KHTML, like Gecko) NF/4.0.0.7.9 NintendoBrowser/5.1.0.15785</code>. I am SO glad their useragent isn&#39;t the usual fugly spaghetti soup that most browsers come up with. The screen size is 1280 by 720.</p>
<p>I remember when people made websites for the Nintendo DS, back when the browser (made by Opera) came in a <em><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/browser/index.html" title="Nintendo DS Browser&#39;s official site">cartridge</a></em>. I still have mine btw. It also came with RAM (&quot;Memory Expansion Pak&quot;) you put in the GBA slot for a whopping 8MB. IGN gave it a 3.5 out of 10. HAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
<p>Good times. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoiler alert, Time Machine is trash.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was minding my business one day (October 27th) and I thought, oh! What&#39;s this? A &quot;recommended update&quot;? &quot;Oh sure, I&#39;ll update to macOS High Sierra Beta 5, while I wait to pre-order my iPhone X at 3am.&quot; Updating my OS is something I&#39;ve done <em>countless</em> times before. Apple waits until 1~3am to let me know there&#39;s a software update or just performs one while I&#39;m asleep. I awake the following morning to find my computer more secure than it was the previous day. Guess what happened this time? On the day of my friggin&#39; <em>marriage</em> (at 2am)?</p>
<p>I glance at my computer and see a software update...stuck. No worries, I&#39;ll reboot! Okay, Recovery Mode! Also, Restore from Time Machine...wtf? Why the hell did it stop at 39%? <em>opens logs</em> Can&#39;t find linker for CoreSomethingOrOther? Good grief, reboot! Ghostbusters logo in white, sans ghost. WHAT. THE. FUCK. I open the Apple Support app, choose my laptop from my devices list, and chat with a rep. After confirming I didn&#39;t want to book a Genius Bar appointment on my wedding day, I shut down my computer and went to bed in a huff (I prefaced my availability and was still asked...<em>bruh</em>).</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few days and I&#39;m talking to a nice Genius about my computer issue (and Nintendo Switch, he&#39;s trying to justify buying one). He performs many of the same things I did to try and get my computer to work. Lo and behold, my computer lives! It breathes! It scrolls the wrong direction by default (Natural Scrolling is WRONG, you <strong>heathens</strong>)! I eagerly head home to perform a three-hour restore from my Time Machine.</p>
<h3 id="i-done-goofed">I done goofed</h3>
<p>I went through the same recovery process I&#39;ve done days prior. What did I see? GHOST. BUSTERS! Managed to get into Recovery Mode to try for the last time, restoring via Time Machine, even though I knew it would end in error. First though, I should reformat the drive with Apple&#39;s File System (APFS)...<strong>Could not create a preboot volume for APFS install</strong>. Welp. Time to fire up the iPad to search for solutions.</p>
<h3 id="salvation">Salvation</h3>
<p>After scouring the Internet for some <em>semblance</em> of a solution, I stumbled upon <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8106654" title="FIX- Could not create a Preboot Volume for APFS install, on Apple Support">a post</a> on Apple&#39;s own support forums by a user named Ethoic. Here is that post in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right Mac users. If your facing the same problem like me then I suggest you listen up. First don&#39;t try to install Mac OS high Sierra again or try anything else. You want to first of delete your drive until you have no drive. Yes I mean no drive. To do this, power off your Mac and then hold command + R and boot up your Mac. This should do the trick. Then delete your drive in disk utility by clicking the minus button on the top right and then enter internet recovery mode by repeating the process though this time adding option and then command + R. Then you will enter the same menu which is mac os utilities and then this time instead of Mac OS High Sierra you will just see Sierra. Go disk utilty  and create a disk this time clicking  + and make a drive calling it Macintosh HD with the format Mac OS Extended. The fix is your removing the APFS system which is what is confusing the drive which for some reason apple can&#39;t figure out them self. Then just click install Mac OS and you should be good to go. Hope your all good and ask anything you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s break that down into steps for ease of reading:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#39;t try to install macOS High Sierra again.</li>
<li>Delete your drive until you have no drive. Seriously.<ul>
<li>Power off your Mac and then hold the <code>Command + R</code> keys while booting.</li>
<li>Delete your drive in Disk Utility. You should only see the macOS Recovery Drive. <strong>Leave this alone.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reboot Mac and hold down the <code>Option + Command + R</code> keys to activate Internet Recovery mode. Oh yeah, you&#39;ll need wifi. Make sure you&#39;re connected.</li>
<li>You should see a drive in Disk Utility. If you don&#39;t see a drive and are unable to click the little plus button to create one, reboot until you do...<em>this was a little weird for me, might not happen to you</em>.<ul>
<li>If you do see a drive, reformat it as &quot;<strong>Mac OS Extended</strong>&quot; and call it &quot;<strong>Macintosh HD</strong>&quot;.</li>
<li>There are a couple options for &quot;Mac OS Extended&quot;. If you have a Time Machine backup you want to keep, know that you should choose &quot;Case sensitive&quot; if you setup your OS to be case sensitive (as an example).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initiate Internet Recovery.</li>
<li>Once the recovery is successful, use Migration Assistant to restore from a Time Machine backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Restoring from Time Machine from scratch has NEVER worked for me and seemingly, 99% of the Internet. Absolute trash IMO. I&#39;m glad I got my data back but jeez. So many hours of my life <em>wasted</em> because of this issue. And the productivity loss (but Super Mario Odyssey <em>gains</em>)! Oh, and I&#39;m not on the macOS beta anymore, haha. Other folks who have the same issue didn&#39;t seem to be on a beta OS but you can never be too sure.</p>
<p>If you are currently on a macOS beta and would like to <a href="https://superuser.com/a/845520" title="How can I get off the OS X beta track?, on SuperUser">hop off that train</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On <code>System Preferences → App Store</code> you have an option called &quot;Your computer is set to receive pre-releases Software Update seeds&quot;, use the button <code>Change</code> and select <code>Do Not Show Pre-release Updates</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps! 🕸</p>

        <updated>2017-10-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somehow, I got lucky]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was your typical (angsty) teenager. Like most people, I was trying to find my voice, trying to find what made me unique, and how I could use that to become popular...needless to say I failed. Once, <strong>for some reason</strong>, I decided to ask one of the most popular girls in school on a date, instead of <em>my actual crush</em> (who was friends with her). That&#39;s a dumb story for another day.</p>
<h3 id="classface">Classface</h3>
<p>In 2002, 14 was my age when a friend of mine called (remember when this happened?) to pester me about joining an &quot;exciting&quot; new social network called, <em>Classface</em>. I&#39;ll paraphrase the conversation here:</p>
<br/>

<p><strong>Cleo:</strong> OMG Paul, you need to join this site. It&#39;s hella dope.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Uh-huh</em>. What site?</p>
<p><strong>Cleo:</strong> It&#39;s called Classface and--</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> (mumbling) That sounds dumb.</p>
<p><strong>Cleo:</strong> --you get to meet people from around the <strong>world</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I don&#39;t even like people <em>near</em> me, why the hell would I like people <strong>far away</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Cleo:</strong> JUST JOIN IT NIGGA.</p>
<br/>

<p>With a heavy sigh I typed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050830203010/http://www.classface.com:80/">www.classface.com</a> into Internet Explorer (yes, seriously) and was greeted with basic, sparse web design reminiscent of the era.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/how-i-met-my-wife-a.png" alt="In due time, I would love seeing this everyday"/></p>
<p>Back then, no one thought about the need for private profiles. After all, wouldn&#39;t you <em>want</em> people to find you? I spent a couple minutes looking at random profiles until I saw a face that took me aback. Here was this girl from Phenix City, Alabama (what the hell is &quot;Phenix&quot;, I thought at the time, shouldn&#39;t it be &quot;Phoenix&quot;?) and she had such a genuinely happy smile. &quot;Keisha Page&quot;, I thought to myself, &quot;I like that name&quot;. She was <em>fiiiiine</em> as hell too! I hovered over whatever button to get to the next random profile while having an internal discussion with myself.</p>
<br/>

<p><strong>Lame Voice:</strong> Wowee, who the hell is THAT?</p>
<p><strong>Cooler Voice:</strong> Your future girl bro!</p>
<p><strong>Lame Voice:</strong> Nah, that&#39;d never happen.</p>
<p><strong>Cooler Voice:</strong> Not with that attitude! Just say hi.</p>
<p><strong>Lame Voice:</strong> Really? No way man, I&#39;m nervous.</p>
<p><strong>Cooler Voice:</strong> You can&#39;t be a bitch <em>all</em> your life. You can&#39;t even tell Shawna you like her, you can at least tell a girl who lives THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY that she looks cute. She realize you a scrub? Delete your account!</p>
<br/>

<p>And so, that&#39;s what I did! I scoured her profile for an opener and saw that she was a fan of Degrassi (the Drake era). I believe I wrote something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I just joined this site and I just happened to find your page. I wanted to let you know that you have a pretty smile anyhoo did you see what Skinner did to Marco last week? What a bum, yeah, Jimmy should&#39;ve said something to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(For those who don&#39;t know, Drake&#39;s character was named Jimmy on the show.)</p>
<p>I anxiously awaited her reply and probably played Road Rash on a Shockwave site to pass the time. To my delight, she thanked me and our friendship flourished thanks to our shared interests. I&#39;d like to take a timeout to publicly thank <a href="https://twitter.com/drake" title="Drake on Twitter">Drake</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/missandrealewis" title="Andrea Lewis on Twitter">Andrea Lewis</a> (my favorite person on the show), and everyone else from Degrassi for making this possible.</p>
<p>Classface eventually became a lame place to be and it was their fault. They had the <strong>terrible</strong> idea to redesign the site but with no UX sense. No one knew where to go to do things you could do in the original version and I believe they messed the site up <em>more</em> trying to fix it. So, everyone moved to Myspace.</p>
<h3 id="myspace">Myspace</h3>
<p>It was during this time that Keisha gave me her phone number (holla!) and I heard her Southern accent for the first time and we would talk for <em>hours</em> about how wack our parents were, dreams for the future, and everything in-between.</p>
<p>Years later, I would reminisce about those conversations and create music. Here&#39;s a sampling of those tracks:</p>

></iframe>

<p><strong>Dusty Stars</strong> is from <a href="https://thewibby.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-the-love-lounge-vol-01" title="Music from the Love Lounge, Vol. 01 on Bandcamp">Music from the Love Lounge, Vol. 01</a> (this cuts off early for some reason, probably data corruption) and <strong>Remember When</strong> is from <a href="https://thewibby.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-the-love-lounge-vol-02" title="Music from the Love Lounge, Vol. 02 on Bandcamp">Vol. 02</a>. I sometimes find music a better conduit to express my thoughts than simply talking.</p>
<p>Keisha and I got busy with our own lives and communicated less but I would check her profile every couple months to see what was new. At some point, I saw she was in a relationship with a guy I instantly disliked and partly because I was being a hater. From where I sat, thousands of miles away, it seemed like he wasn&#39;t treating her right and her journal posts confirmed my suspicions. When she uploaded a picture of herself with a baby on a beach, my unspoken hopes were smashed.</p>
<p>Welp.</p>
<h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3>
<p>Like with Classface, Myspace became lame and so everyone jumped to Facebook. Keisha and I continued our random check-ins over the years but it wasn&#39;t until October 2011 that we reconnected. Her marriage to that <em>terrible</em> guy was over for quite some time but I was just happy to converse as a friend.</p>
<p>The following month, we became closer than I ever expected (or hoped) and I had the bright idea to try and visit her for Thanksgiving. She thought it was a fantastic idea so I begged my mom to buy me roundtrip tickets to Jacksonville, FL...my mom is a bit paranoid. Catfishing, abduction, and other crazy things happen all the time so she wasn&#39;t super keen about the idea at first. She made me promise to text her as soon as I landed (I forgot to do so until the next morning and got a rather disgruntled phone call, haha). Keisha and I were using Skype at this point and I was one <em>thousand</em> per cent sure she was real. 😏</p>
<h3 id="florida">Florida</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/how-i-met-my-wife-b.jpg" alt="Me, after realizing what I got myself into"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/how-i-met-my-wife-c.jpg" alt="(Kinda) high-school sweethearts"/></p>
<p>When Keisha greeted me at the airport, it was surreal. We both had goofy grins on our faces and then hugged. Our immediate, simultaneous remarks were: &quot;OMG you&#39;re so tall/short!&quot;. LOL</p>
<p>Luckily, her siblings and daughter liked me and we had a fun week full of jokes (you gotta come prepared with some zingers &#39;round these folks), fun, and of course...Thanksgiving. 😉</p>
<p>In fact, it was Thanksgiving Day that I asked/confirmed our relationship status. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> if you&#39;re forgetful of dates like I am, make sure anniversaries are on a date you <strong>know</strong> you won&#39;t forget. BWAHAHAHA!</p>
<p>Y&#39;know those movies where a main character departs for a flight and the other main character is super sad with tears in their eyes but the first character wants to be strong for the second and tries really hard to keep it together? Yeah, that was us when it was time for me to head back to Boston. As soon as I turned away from Keisha and entered the airport, I was boo-hoo-Academy-Award-winning-actor-Viola-Davis crying. My. Tears. Were. <em>Fugly</em>. I looked like my mom AND dad took turns beating my ass for stealing cookies and smudging a wall they just painted after mooning the elderly Polish woman next door. It was bad man. My chest hurt.</p>
<p>Some of my friends at the time thought I was crazy to date someone on the other side of the country, and for a couple years at that! Keisha and I would visit each other at least twice a year for <em>physical</em> reminders of why we were together and spoke/texted nearly every day and that nourished our <em>emotional</em> and <em>mental</em> needs.</p>
<h3 id="massachusetts">Massachusetts</h3>
<p>With our generation, I&#39;ve seen and continue to see posts on social media where people are hella frustrated about relation- <del>ships</del> <em>shits</em> they get into. The ratio of disappointment appears to be balanced. I believe 90% of issues could be solved with communication. Notice I didn&#39;t prefix the word &quot;more&quot;. I don&#39;t think people communicate <em>at all</em> anymore. Millenials would rather swipe left/right and take pics or make statuses for likes that don&#39;t matter instead of communicating for love that <em>does</em> matter...ooh, that&#39;d make a great post in of itself.</p>
<p>Even though Keisha and I knew each other for 10 years, we still had to learn <em>how to live together</em>. I was a guy in a two-bedroom apartment with a long-distance girlfriend and when she moved in, I suddenly had a three-year-old stepdaughter and couldn&#39;t fucking swear all the time. And furniture. Oh my <em>gawd</em>, Keisha had so much furniture. I had a desk...and a sad excuse for a bed. During Keisha&#39;s first night living in Massachusetts, a speeding driver knocked off the sideview mirror from her parked car (<strong>pro tip:</strong> don&#39;t live on Main Street, side streets are better).</p>
<p>I found that (gasp) Keisha could irritate me sometimes! I irritated her <strong>all</strong> the time! There was a period in the first year where everything could&#39;ve gone up in smoke <em>but we communicated</em>. My default way of dealing with things at the time was to shut down and stew, have mock debates in my head. Little did I know, Keisha does that on a regular basis and always had an immediate response to everything I could possibly say. Hoo boy, I&#39;m a pro now but that was not a fun time.</p>
<p>Compromise was something else I had to learn. I was resistant at first but when faced with the prospect of losing her and an adorable little girl who now saw me as &quot;daddy&quot; instead of &quot;Paul&quot;, I quickly learned to adjust. I&#39;m not a perfect guy today, but I am <em>perfect for my family</em> (or damn close to it). Don&#39;t hashtag, retweet, or share &quot;relationship goals&quot;...just learn how to compromise, communicate, and ensure your partner is on the same page. Remember when your parents made you eat nasty things with dinner? I would mix the nasty things with food I <em>did</em> like to get them out the way so I could enjoy the rest of my meal. The same thing applies to relationships; do the hard stuff now so you can enjoy growing together later.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>I proposed to Keisha on Easter, earlier this year. Remember my pro tip from earlier? BWAHAHAHA!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/how-i-met-my-wife-d.jpg" alt="Please ignore the fact that all of us are looking at ourselves and not the camera"/></p>
<p>And now? We&#39;re married! As far as what&#39;s next...growth. Our focus is creating an environment where our kids are nurtured, growing, and happy. That means becoming homeowners so we <em>really</em> own our own space, and helping each other thrive in our fields.</p>
<p>Keisha went from being a sailor in the Navy, waking up at the bootycrack of dawn to work out, have 24-hour shifts for some thing or other (idk, I&#39;m a civilian) to becoming a stay-at-home-mom because we don&#39;t trust anyone with our toddler until he learns how to speak. We&#39;ve been spooked by online videos of &quot;caretakers&quot; smacking babies in the face and parents wondering why their child has a fear of pillows. NOPE. 🖕🏾</p>
<p>Since our son&#39;s been born, Keisha has garnered a reputation in mom groups as THE go-to person when you want a custom designed shirt, poofy skirts, onesies, booties, and so on. I&#39;ve designed logos for her and provided my designer-y expertise on how to deal with clients and she&#39;s flourishing!</p>
<p>I&#39;m a simple man, I just want world domination.</p>
<br/>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that two 14-year-old kids would connect on social media in 2002, only to marry each other 15 years later. Paul Webb and Lakeisha Page met online...Webb and Page met on a webpage. WebbPage. See? That&#39;s some <em>high-quality</em> movie shit. 🕸</p>
<h3 id="extra">Extra</h3>
<p>This may sound completely fabricated to you, dear reader, but Keisha and I lived in <em>the same city</em> and our fathers were stationed at <em>the same military base</em> at <em>the same time</em>. Clarksville, Tennessee was the city, Fort Campbell was the military base, 1994-1997 was the time. Fort Campbell had &quot;family days&quot; and there would be lots of kids playing together. I don&#39;t remember any of the kids I saw/played with but it&#39;s quite possible that we&#39;ve seen each other back then.</p>
<p>How weird is that?</p>
<h3 id="ps">P.S.</h3>
<p>During one of Keisha&#39;s early visits to Massachusetts, I asked her to appear on that year&#39;s release of Music from the Love Lounge. It&#39;s a fitting end to a post like this, check it out (beats by me)! 🕸</p>

        <updated>2017-09-12T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This looks like everything I've ever wanted]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For as long as I can remember, I&#39;ve always wanted a futuristic communication device <em>that also looked the part</em>. Arguably, every smartphone today fits the former description. The latter? A whole bunch of <strong>meh</strong>. Sharp&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sharp-Aquos-Crystal-Sprint-Silver/dp/B00NWYANAI" title="Aquos Crystal on Amazon">Aquos Crystal</a> was the best contender before the X IMO, but I don&#39;t use Android.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-a.jpg" alt="Dat sweet design, dayum"/></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-x" title="iPhone X page on apple.com">iPhone X</a>, a device leaked by a disgruntled employee inside Apple days before today&#39;s event. It <strong>would have been nice</strong> to have a proper surprise but here in 2017, assholes are a dime a dozen. Anyhoo, this futuristic communication device succeeds in looking like such and that pleases me <em>immensely</em>. For context, I am currently rocking a 256GB Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. I purchased this phone and configuration primarily for the camera...<em>and shiny body</em>.</p>
<p>My fiancé used to find my <del>constant filming</del> role as family historian irritating but has come to accept it now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMgK_E6_GAE" title="Adorable little things in Zelda">yahaha</a>! She was pregnant with our son when I bought it and I correctly predicted that most of my content would be of him. My daughter is becoming a <del>pain in my ass</del> tween and I don&#39;t want to miss out on her development/funny moments as well. Believe it or not, I&#39;ve filled my phone at least twice over the past year and would&#39;ve reached my phone&#39;s storage limits a helluva lot quicker if I chose a lesser capacity.</p>
<p>I explain all this to say I&#39;m going to be one of those people plunking down $1149 for the piece of mind 256GB gives me. Fight me. (No really, some people seem pretty mad about the iPhone X on Twitter) 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to run down my favorite new features about the <strong>definitive</strong> iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>BUCKLE UP GANG</strong></p>
<h3 id="cameras">Cameras</h3>
<p>Anyone who visits <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spacemanfresh" title="Paul Anthony Webb&#39;s Instagram page">my Instagram page</a> can see that I clearly <em>love</em> taking Portrait photos. While not perfect (Apple needs to find a way to deal with curly hair), I can usually get some damn good shots on a consistent basis. The optical image stabilization allows me to run after my kids and get awesome action shots that aren&#39;t blurry as hell.</p>
<p>For the X, Apple includes a <em>second</em> optical image stabilizer. This will make my favorite kind of photo to take <em>even better</em>. In additional to a better-looking Portrait mode, we gain a new feature called &quot;Portrait Lighting&quot;. Thanks to the extra sensors Apple seems keen on packing into iPhone, Portrait Lighting allows me to light my subjects in five different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Natural Light</li>
<li>Studio Light</li>
<li>Contour Light</li>
<li>Stage Light</li>
<li>Stage Light Mono</li>
</ol>
<p>These modes emulate studio lighting and of course, since this is software it can (and will) improve over time. The X will automatically optimize images as I take them. In theory that sounds great but, I don&#39;t know just yet if I&#39;ll like how this optimization happens.</p>
<p>When Apple initially introduced Portrait Mode, I&#39;ve wanted it on the front-facing camera and it&#39;s a reality now with the X (and iPhone 8 Plus, the Plus model always has a better/extra camera than the non-Plus model). FINALLY. Get ready for yours truly (and aspiring Instagram models) to use this feature a LOT.</p>
<p>Another feature I&#39;m particularly excited for is the capability to shoot <strong>4K video at 24fps</strong>. This is cinema-quality videography, <em>in my friggin&#39; pocket</em>. Are you <em>kidding</em> me?! This, coupled with the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tiffencompany/steadicam-volt-smartphone-stabilizer-shake-free-vi" title="Steadicam Volt on Kickstarter">Steadicam</a> coming in the mail soon, is going to make my videos <em>amazing</em>. I do believe I win for best family historian this year, the holidays are gonna be cinematically <em>gorgeous daaaaahling</em>.</p>
<h3 id="face-id">Face ID</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-b.jpg" alt="Internal shot of what makes Face ID possible"/></p>
<p><del>When Craig Federighi bungled the initial demo of Face ID, I was concerned for obvious reasons. Then he tried several more times and it worked consistently each of those times, which leads me to believe he messed up somehow that first time (go watch first impressions videos from people who were actually at today&#39;s event, Face ID gets demoed in some).</del></p>
<p>Update from Apple to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/13/face-id-demo-fail-details" title="Apple explains what exactly happened when Face ID &#39;failed&#39; during iPhone X demo, on 9to5Mac">9to5Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time,&quot; says a rep, &quot;and didn&#39;t realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face. After failing a number of times, because they weren&#39;t Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode.&quot; In other words, &quot;Face ID worked as it was designed to.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My main concern continues to be, <em>will this work for me?</em> I&#39;m a black man with a beard who wears glasses. <strong>Snapchat doesn&#39;t think I exist</strong> most times, whereas my family can use Snapchat&#39;s face-tracking masks without issue. While Apple&#39;s site shows a brown man with/without facial hair, glasses, and a hat, I haven&#39;t seen any press media showcasing dark-skinned people using Face ID successfully. Color concern may be unwarranted since an infrared camera, infrared light, and dot mapping is used but facial hair? I look forward to tech reviewers testing this before launch. If MKBHD doesn&#39;t grow a beard, <strong>I</strong> will be the one to test this for myself (and share the results with you all).</p>
<p>Apple claims their Face ID neural networks/machine learning will track your face&#39;s changes over time. It will be interesting to see how it copes with people undergoing reconstructive surgery and related facial matters.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-design">Hardware Design</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-c.jpg" alt="iPhone 4, is that you?"/></p>
<p>The iPhone 4 was a favorite to many and I remember the collective sadness online when the iPhone 5 was released looking very different from the 4. I had a Palm Pre at the time so I didn&#39;t care, haha. The X has a glass back like the 4, but adds surgical grade stainless steel for the sides and bottom. The phone looks seamless and I&#39;m curious to know how it feels in the hand.</p>
<p>I regularly give my son my phone while it&#39;s recording on the front-facing camera because the results end up being pretty funny. Being a year and some months old, he <em>does</em> drop/throw/trip over/attempt to eat my phone so the extra sturdy design of the X will be much appreciated (my 7 Plus is holding up well though!). I&#39;m thinking about creating a YouTube channel in a few months to showcase #dadlife, and you may see some of these clips.</p>
<p>According to Apple, normal ol&#39; OLED wasn&#39;t good enough. They&#39;ve made a &quot;Super Retina&quot; HDR display with a million to one contrast ratio, high resolution and brightness, wide color support, and excellent color accuracy. In addition, the X gains &quot;True Tone&quot; technology like the latest iPad Pro. This automatically adjusts the color temperature of the screen to match the lighting environment you&#39;re in, to reduce eyestrain.</p>
<h3 id="qi-charging">Qi Charging</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-d.jpg" alt="Qi charging, never saw this coming"/></p>
<p>The glass back of the X enables wireless charging and to be honest, I did not think this would actually happen. Of course, the Apple-issued charging mat isn&#39;t coming until sometime in 2018 but the fact that it&#39;s coming at all is great. In the meantime, you can certainly purchase Qi charging pads from other manufacturers. Apple says they&#39;ve wanted <del>wireless</del> inductive charging since the original iPhone and a decade later they&#39;ve done it! <em>Cue Android users saying they&#39;ve had it first.</em></p>
<p>Qi is an industry standard for wirelessly charging devices. One of my best friends swears by Qi and remarked that some fairweather Qi manufacturers are gonna come back into the fold (LG and HTC). I hope Qi and USB-C take the tech industry by storm. One cable to rule them all and wireless charging for the rest!</p>
<p>Clarification about Qi and AirPower, from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations" title="Thoughts and Observations on the Products Announced at This Week&#39;s iPhone X Introductory Event, on Daring Fireball">John Gruber</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to think of it is that AirPower is to Qi what AirPods are to Bluetooth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AirPower is going to be a superset of Qi with a layer of non-standard Apple technology on top of it to make it better</strong>, just like how AirPods are a superset of Bluetooth with non-standard Apple technology on top. So iPhone 8 and iPhone X can charge on any Qi charging pad, like the Belkin and Mophie ones that Apple promoted on stage. Likewise, AirPods can be used as a regular Bluetooth headset connected to any Bluetooth device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But AirPower can do things Qi cannot — it can charge Apple Watch and the upcoming new AirPod case. <strong>Apple Watch and the AirPod case are not Qi devices — you cannot charge them on a Qi charging pad.</strong> That&#39;s similar to the way AirPods (and the Beats headphones also equipped with Apple&#39;s W1 chip) can do things regular Bluetooth headsets cannot — in particular, the seamless pairing process, and the lower audio playback latency enabled by the W1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main difference between the non-standard aspects of AirPower compared to AirPods is that <strong>Apple is pledging to offer their improvements to the Qi consortium.</strong> If the consortium accepts them, third-party companies will be able to make AirPower-like charging pads that do work with Apple Watch, the new AirPod case, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was confused about Apple Watch and AirPod cases charging on Apple&#39;s pad because they didn&#39;t specify if only the <em>latest</em> versions of those devices had Air Power capability, or if past and present versions would work out of the box. I&#39;m <em>still</em> unsure but I&#39;ll update when I find out.</p>
<h3 id="animoji">Animoji</h3>
<p><video autoplay controls loop muted playsinline src="/assets/videos/2017/iphone-x-dream-phone-a.mp4"></video></p>
<p>The TrueDepth camera on the X (in conjunction with the A11 Bionic chip) analyzes 50 different muscle movements on your face and then applies them to one of 12 pre-selected <del>emoji</del> Animoji. You can record video messages with Animoji (and your voice!) and share them inside of Messages. It should be possible to export these videos outside of Messages too. I hope there&#39;s a way to create your own Animoji (if you&#39;re a developer). I&#39;d create a 3D version of myself and use that Animoji exclusively.</p>
<p>Apple just made it so anyone can be a (generic) Pixar character.</p>
<h3 id="criticism">Criticism</h3>
<p>On social media today, I&#39;ve seen people complain (some, vehemently so) about the price of the phone and say things like, &quot;This isn&#39;t worth it&quot;, &quot;iPhone eXtortion&quot;, &quot;Just get a laptop&quot;, and so on. I believe these people are reactionary and failing to see the bigger picture. They see the price and think, &quot;That price...for a <em>phone</em>?&quot;, and stop their train of thought...<em>derail it</em> even. In reality, <em>you aren&#39;t paying for just a phone</em>. You are paying for a phone that rivals a DSLR camera and last I checked, those cameras are <strong>not</strong> cheap but, no one complains about them (probably because expectations of DSLRs haven&#39;t changed over their lifetime, at least when compared to phones).</p>
<p>For me, my personal communication device is only referred to as a phone because of legacy reasons (and it&#39;s shorter to say). It&#39;s kind of like how floppy disks are still the universal symbol for save but we sync now. Hell, <em>even the phone icon</em> is legacy. Phones these days are flat slabs of metal, only medical and government facilities have classic telephones.</p>
<p>Another bit of criticism I&#39;ve seen is regarding the ease of which law enforcement can forcefully obtain access to someone&#39;s iPhone X. The owner could be handcuffed while a police officer holds the phone to their face and then swipe to unlock the phone. As a black man in America, I find this to be the <strong>only</strong> valid criticism I&#39;ve seen thus far. Just a few days ago though, I found a solution for that! It requires you to be observant and proactive but I tend to have my hand on my phone when I see police anyway...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/17/ios-11-emergency-sos-disables-touch-id" title="Article about iOS 11&#39;s SOS feature, on MacRumors">Juli Clover reported</a> about the &quot;SOS Feature&quot; in iOS 11 for MacRumors (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emergency SOS is activated by pressing on the sleep/wake button of an iPhone five times in rapid succession. When the requisite number of presses is complete, it brings up a screen that offers buttons to power off the iPhone, bring up your Medical ID (if filled out) and make an emergency 911 call.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Along with these options, there&#39;s also a cancel button. <strong>If you hit the sleep/wake button five times and then hit cancel, it disables Touch ID and requires a passcode before Touch ID can be re-enabled.</strong> Touch ID is also disabled if you actually make an emergency call.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a handy hidden feature because <strong>it allows Touch ID to be disabled discretely</strong> in situations where someone might be able to force a phone to be unlocked with a fingerprint, such as a robbery or an arrest. With Touch ID disabled in this way, there is no way to physically unlock an iPhone with a finger without the device&#39;s passcode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that <strong>there&#39;s no real way to tell that Touch ID has been disabled in this manner</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading this, I tested it immediately and it works like a charm. I advise anyone with law enforcement concerns to practice this when you upgrade your phone to iOS 11 or get the iPhone 8/8 Plus/X. It&#39;s probably a good idea to do this while going through customs as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2017/09/16 update:<br/><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/interview-apples-craig-federighi-answers-some-burning-questions-about-face-id" title="Interview: Apple&#39;s Craig Federighi answers some burning questions about Face ID">TechCrunch interviewed Craig Federighi</a> and here&#39;s how the above feature works on iPhones 8 and X (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On older phones the sequence was to click 5 times [on the power button], but on newer phones like iPhone 8 and iPhone X, <strong>if you grip the side buttons on either side and hold them a little while — we&#39;ll take you to the power down [screen]. But that also has the effect of disabling Face ID.</strong> So, if you were in a case where the thief was asking to hand over your phone — you can just reach into your pocket, squeeze it, and it will disable Face ID. It will do the same thing on iPhone 8 to disable Touch ID.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the squeeze can be of either volume button plus the power button. I&#39;m going to test/practice this when I get mine.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>I&#39;m excited.</p>
<p>Like the original iPhone, I think iPhone X heralds a new era in smartphone design, development, and creative possibilities and I can&#39;t wait to get started. The AR games demoed at the event bored me, but ARkit demos on Twitter are <em>amazing</em>. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing who creates the breakout AR app everyone&#39;s gotta have. I think there&#39;s opportunity for nearly every app to offer something interesting in the AR space, if only for demo purposes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to upgrading to an Series 3 Apple Watch. The cellular version is not for me as I&#39;m hardly ever far away from my phone (and I don&#39;t jog). I like the improved heart rate monitor and since my son&#39;s birth I&#39;ve become more interested in my overall health. My Pebble Time is also showing its age by slowly breaking down so upgrade time is soon.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great event. Leakers don&#39;t deserve happiness. I&#39;m going to download Final Cut. 🕸</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2017/1984-review"/>
        <updated>2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A nightmarish vision of the future.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first half of this book was gripping and the second half was unpleasant to me, but I had to see how it ended.</p>
<p>1984 is an oft-referenced book when tech writers and privacy-conscious people talk about governmental encroachment upon citizens&#39; privacy and abuses of power to obtain private information. And Facebook (haven&#39;t been a fan for some time). By the way, there&#39;s going to be slight spoilers moving forward...</p>
<p><br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>Get ready!</p>
<p><br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>The story follows a man, Winston Smith, living in what could only be called a &quot;negative utopia&quot; in the year 1984 (the book was published in 1950). The country he lives in, Oceania, is controlled by the Party and the Party quite literally rewrites history. As far as anyone knows, the Party invented steamboats and airplanes and everything else. Those born before the formation of the Party know the truth but it doesn&#39;t matter. Questioning otherwise results in sure death. Winston&#39;s only purpose in life is to rewrite facts whenever the Party deems it necessary. If there was a speech in which the Party claimed something and recorded facts said otherwise, those recorded facts (in the form of newspapers, books, video, &amp;c) were subsequently destroyed and teams of people would recreate the aforementioned media to &quot;prove&quot; the Party was and always is right in all things.</p>
<p>Prime example: in the beginning of the story, Oceania was at war with Eurasia and Eastasia was their ally...only, the opposite was declared later at a war rally <em>mid-speech</em> and the populace went with it. &quot;The enemy&quot; tricked people into putting up posters of their enemy instead of their ally and that &quot;proved&quot; just how diabolical they were (nevermind the fact that thousands of people were <em>just</em> cheering for Oceania and Eastasia). Winston and everyone else in the Outer Party worked several 16 hour days to remove any mention of prior facts. Knowing something to be false, yet believing in it anyway is referred to as <em>doublethink</em>. If the Party said 2 + 2 = 5, <strong>you&#39;d better believe it, or else</strong>.</p>
<p>Citizens caught by the Thought Police for <em>crimethink</em> (anything remotely negative about or opposing the principles of the Party or &quot;Big Brother&quot;) get sent to a building called &quot;Ministry of Love&quot;, where they are tortured and starved before being mentally broken down so brainwashing can take hold. Once these people are released, they &quot;live&quot; out their lives doing menial work before eventually getting a bullet in the back of their head.</p>
<br/>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing a good job selling you on this book, especially considering how I mentioned how unpleasant I found the second half. Bear with me here. There was <strong>one</strong> neat thing and that was the creation of a new language, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak" title="Newspeak article on Wikipedia">Newspeak</a></em>, which dealt with the merging of words (and eradication of others) to simplify English. Of course, any words that might inspire a revolution of some sort were abolished (as well as the concept of freedom). Can&#39;t have people using a language created by the Party to overthrow them. Talk about a slap in the face!</p>
<p>Similarities of American society today and the dystopia of Oceania weren&#39;t difficult to see. In fact, they jumped out at me. Fake news, alternative facts, and blind followers of <a href="https://youtu.be/DnpO_RTSNmQ?t=20m53s" title="Make Donald Drumpf Again">Drumpf</a> who regularly engage in doublethink. Quite frankly, I found it terrifying. Thankfully, we don&#39;t live in a world where the depressing society of Oceania could thrive. No one entity has control over data and knowledge (doesn&#39;t stop &#39;em from trying though). If nothing else, 1984 serves as a cautionary tale of what <em>could</em> happen if everyone lost their damn minds and subsequently decided they didn&#39;t care.</p>
<p>If you like reading about oppressive dystopias, <a href="http://amzn.to/2vUVoiH" title="Buy 1984 on Amazon">1984</a> is the book for you. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lesson in bouncing back.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this summer, I had an interview with MailChimp for their MailChimp Agencies newsletter. Special shoutout goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/mauricecherry" title="The immaculate Maurice Cherry, on Twitter">Maurice Cherry</a> for being the plug for this! If you don&#39;t know much about me and how I got started in the tech space, it&#39;s <a href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/resources-for-partners/a-lesson-in-bouncing-back-from-web-designer-paul-anthony-webb" title="A Lesson in Bouncing Back from Web Designer Paul Anthony Webb">a great read</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from the interview, my tips on how to keep going:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Find someone who will collaborate with you.</strong> &quot;<em>Collaboration means you get someone else&#39;s experience,</em>&quot; Webb says. &quot;<em>It can also help you keep a realistic mindset of what&#39;s possible.</em>&quot; A lack of knowledge combined with unrealistic expectations can be a toxic combination during any project. Collaborating with a partner can help you avoid those pitfalls.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Find value in seeing results.</strong> &quot;<em>One thing that motivates me is that I just want to see things happen,</em>&quot; Webb says. &quot;<em>If I have an idea and don&#39;t see anybody else doing it, then I&#39;m going to do it just to see the result.</em>&quot; Even if your project isn&#39;t going the way you hoped, there&#39;s still a lot that can be learned from seeing it through to the end.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Find a way to simplify.</strong> &quot;<em>Stuff takes on a life of its own sometimes,</em>&quot; Webb says. &quot;<em>There&#39;s usually a way to make it simpler. When a project gets too frustrating, I start to look for what I can strip away.</em>&quot; When you feel overwhelmed, take a break and come back with a fresh eye toward how you can make things simpler. It may help breathe new life into your project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, check out these dope illustrations of me by <a href="http://www.marcoboulais.com" title="The portfolio of Marco Boulais">Marco Boulais</a>. I love them so much and I emailed him to get some commissioned stuff done, but haven&#39;t heard anything yet.</p>

        <updated>2017-08-19T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being let down all the time is...a let down.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kickstarter is a great place for people to financially support those with a great idea and a prototype, but need a little assistance to make that idea a reality. This is why I signed up for the platform in 2012. Five years later and I&#39;m sick of the bullshit that seems to emanate from the projects I back.</p>
<p>Of the 39 projects I have contributed money to, 10 are delayed (some are delayed by about a year or more). <strong>Good thing I&#39;m not holding my breath.</strong> Let&#39;s take a look at those projects, starting with the oldest.</p>
<h3 id="star-citizen">Star Citizen</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-a.jpg" alt="Star Citizen on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen" title="Star Citizen on Kickstarter">game</a>, by Cloud Imperium Games Corporation, was successfully funded on November 19th, 2012. I backed at the $37 tier (Digital Scout) for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a digital copy of the finished game (PC)</li>
<li>RSI Aurora spaceship ready to fly</li>
<li>1,000 Galactic Credits</li>
<li>exclusive access to the Alpha + Beta</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date for this was November 2014. Of the unfulfilled projects I backed, I am the <em>least</em> sore about Star Citizen because 1) I can play the Alpha when I get a PC (I have a Mac) and 2) there are regular updates. Not just, &quot;Oh hey guys, here&#39;s a wall of text and a pic or two&quot;, it&#39;s actual gameplay and something I can interact with.</p>
<p>I think the CEO got overly ambitious but at least it&#39;s not No Man&#39;s Sky-tier of fuckedupness.</p>
<h3 id="mighty-no-9">Mighty No. 9</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-b.jpg" alt="Mighty No. 9 on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mightyno9/mighty-no-9" title="Mighty No. 9 on Kickstarter">game</a>, by comcept, is currently the laughing stock of the gaming world and a cautionary tale for game developers looking to create a Kickstarter for their game. It was successfully funded on October 1st, 2013. I backed at the $60 tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a physical game box (Western/Japanese style)</li>
<li>printed retro-style game manual (English/Japanese)</li>
<li>exclusive in-game golden hero (backer-exclusive color variation of Beck, the game&#39;s hero)</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date for this was April 2015. I just got the physical rewards a week or two ago. The Nintendo 3DS version? Still waiting for it. I have a Switch now...</p>
<h3 id="sa-the-umbrella-reimagined">Sa: The Umbrella Reimagined</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-c.jpg" alt="The Sa umbrella on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/860103721/satm-the-umbrella-reimagined" title="The Sa umbrella on Kickstarter">umbrella</a>, by Justin Nagelberg and Matthew Waldman, was successfully funded on December 1st, 2014. I backed at the $69 tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>one Sa (early limited special)</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was March 2015. Since being successfully funded, backers have gotten <del>updates</del> essays twice a year about why shipping has been delayed two years. Basically, because the umbrella is so different that factories have to be taught how to work on components. Factories is plural because they&#39;ve gone through a couple because of shutdowns. Who the hell knows when I&#39;m gonna get this thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>2017/09/14 update<ul>
<li>another essay, but with TL;DR version!</li>
<li>fully functioning prototype</li>
<li>noticed weird things with prototype, fixes for those things is in progress</li>
<li>shipping has been pushed back to Winter/Spring 2018</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote a backer, &quot;Great to see that after nearly 3 years you nearly have a working prototype&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="the-light-phone">The Light Phone</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-d.jpg" alt="The Light Phone on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thelightphone/the-light-phone" title="The Light Phone on Kickstarter">phone</a>, by Light, was successfully funded on June 27th, 2015. I backed at the $25 tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Light Book. It documents the process of building the Light Phone and includes  photos, drawings, and essays. It will cover the entire story from ideation to insights into the manufacturing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was June 2016. I messaged the founders last month about the book and this was the response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not yet. We would like to include our entire journey of the Light Phone and we believe that there is more to come. We will email backers when we plan to release the book. Thank you for asking!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how much more of &quot;the journey&quot; needs to be documented but I hope I get it before the end of 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>2018/02/28 update<ul>
<li>creators are launching a new campaign for Light Phone 2, but on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2-smartphone-design" title="The Light Phone on Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> this time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#39;s what they had to say about backers that pledged for the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have users that pledged for a process book in our original campaign, and we want to acknowledge that we have not at all forgotten about you. We&#39;ve continued to document the process and want the book to encompass the Light Phone journey in its entirety, through this second generation as well. We will offer the book as a pledge in the next campaign as well (a $50 donation). We have a few ideas for ways to make this even more special for those of you who originally donated with a limited edition bonus too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end of the Indiegogo campaign is scheduled to end April 2019. The Kickstarter campaign ended June 2015. I was supposed to get the book June 2016.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-e.jpg" alt="Das Keyboard 5Q on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1229573443/das-keyboard-5q-the-cloud-connected-keyboard" title="Das Keyboard 5Q on Kickstarter">keyboard</a>, by Das Keyboard, was successfully funded on July 30th, 2016. I backed at the $139 (early bird) tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>one Das Keyboard 5Q for $90 off the $229 retail price.</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was January 2017. I have a regular Das Keyboard (Mac version) at home and I love it. What drew me to the 5Q was the ability to write scripts to mod the keyboard. You can create light shows, make certain keys change color due to a specified event, and so on. Super customizable! Anyhoo, people are pissed off because the company makes keyboards for a living and we <strong>still</strong> don&#39;t have ours.</p>
<p>Welp.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2017/08/25 update</p>
<ul>
<li>Typhoon Hato damaged a factory in Hong Kong</li>
<li>no injuries</li>
<li>raw materials and critical production equipment were protected from damage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2017/08/31 update</p>
<ul>
<li>5Q pilot production will begin in a couple days</li>
<li>full production schedule for the end of September</li>
<li>Kickstarter fulfillment in October, barring any pilot production issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2017/09/25 update</p>
<ul>
<li>solder quality for mechanical switches failed QA</li>
<li>incorrect product packaging</li>
<li>National Day in China for the first week of October</li>
<li>production will start the week of October 30th</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2018/02/28 update</p>
<ul>
<li>keyboards are shipping!</li>
<li>Mac/Linux support is nonexistent...seriously</li>
<li>105-key layout (international) keyboards have damaged switches</li>
<li>according to a Superbacker and another backer who got theirs already, the keyboard is straight <strong>trash</strong> from the hardware to the software</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2018/03/13 update</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened a ticket with Das Keyboard&#39;s support channel to get the address for the 5Q to be changed to one of my best friends. I bought WASD&#39;s <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-104-key-mechanical-keyboard-2923.html">CODE keyboard</a> instead.</li>
<li>Roughly 15 months to deliver what appeared to be a lackluster keyboard of questionable quality. <em>Sigh</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With each update, backers become less enthusiastic or get angry. I think it&#39;s safe to say that the Das Keyboard team isn&#39;t going to make another crowdfunded product for a long time, if ever. <del>Earlier this summer, I joked about getting my 5Q in time for Christmas. At this rate, that looks to be the case.</del> Keep in mind that these people are in the business of producing keyboards and have been doing so since 2005.</p>
<h3 id="tma-2-modular-headphone-system-got-it"><del>TMA-2 Modular Headphone System</del> GOT IT</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-f.jpg" alt="TMA-2 Modular Headphone System on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1733579622/the-wireless-tma-2-modular-headphone-system" title="TMA-2 Modular Headphone System on Kickstarter">wireless headphone system</a>, by AIAIAI, was successfully funded on December 15th, 2016. I backed at the $65 tier (early bird) for:</p>
<ul>
<li>H05 Smart Headband</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was May 2017. AIAIAI&#39;s TMA-2 is a modular headphone system which means if something on my headphones breaks, I can just replace a module or two and not the entire thing. I already own the TMA-2 so what I paid for was the headband to make my headphones wireless. <del>The latest update said this was going to ship at the end of this month. We shall see.</del></p>
<p>I&#39;m tired of using Apple&#39;s shitty ear buds and I&#39;ve gone through two aux dongles already.</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>mass production has been moved to September 11th</li>
<li>Kickstarter orders (1436 of &#39;em) will ship out September 18th - October 6th</li>
<li>I&#39;ve already confirmed with them that orders will ship in order of pledges (I&#39;m backer 46)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2017/09/13 update</p>

<h3 id="indie-microblogging">Indie Microblogging</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-g.png" alt="Indie Microblogging on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing" title="Indie Microblogging on Kickstarter">social network and eBook</a>, by Manton Reece, was successfully funded on February 1st, 2017. I backed at the $10 tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>PDF and ePub versions of the book, plus early access to Micro.blog</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the book topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to adapt blogging tools like WordPress and Tumblr to work with microblogs.</li>
<li>the important role of cross-posting to Twitter, and the best tools out there.</li>
<li>tips for integrating a microblog into an existing weblog.</li>
<li>architecture for microblogs, with a behind-the-scenes look at how Micro.blog was built.</li>
<li>overview of the latest IndieWebCamp and W3C proposals for indie microblogging, such as Webmention and Micropub.</li>
<li>Manton&#39;s personal stories on why it matters so much to preserve content on the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was March 2017. Like Star Citizen, I&#39;m not sore about my eBook reward being delayed. Manton is creating an entire social network by himself and managing a Slack group for backers. I haven&#39;t setup this blog with micro.blog yet either so it looks like we&#39;re both delayed, haha! He&#39;s actively working on finishing the book though.</p>
<h3 id="jack-make-any-headphones-wireless-got-it"><del>Jack: Make Any Headphones Wireless</del> GOT IT</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-h.jpg" alt="Jack on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/podolabs/make-any-headphones-wireless-jack-by-podo-labs" title="Jack on Kickstarter">Jack adapter</a>, by Podo Labs, was successfully funded on February 25th, 2017. I backed at the $25 (early bird) tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>one Jack adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was June 2017. The latest update promises that I&#39;ll get this by the end of October at the latest. You might be wondering why I backed two Kickstarters that are headphone-focused. I like music and I&#39;m beginning to despise wires. Should the battery on my H05 run out, I can attach a cable to it and that cable to the Jack. I&#39;ll have to stuff the cord in my bag or someplace but it&#39;ll still be wireless!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2017/10/06 update</p>
<ul>
<li>Delays of course, but the team makes it seem as though they were blindsided by a Chinese holiday. This isn&#39;t their first KS and from the comments, they have a history of making promises they can&#39;t keep, having tons of delays, and announcing new projects before the current one is fulfilled.</li>
<li>&quot;Production&quot; unit shown doesn&#39;t match prototype, and while understandable to a degree it&#39;s disappointing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2019 May update</p>
<ul>
<li>This was sent to my old address so it took a couple weeks to get to me. Eighteen friggin&#39; months for this thing? SMH. They even had the nerve to advertise new Kickstarter campaigns while I waited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steadicam-volt-got-it"><del>Steadicam Volt</del> GOT IT</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-i.jpg" alt="Steadicam Volt on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tiffencompany/steadicam-volt-smartphone-stabilizer-shake-free-vi" title="Steadicam Volt on Kickstarter">smartphone stabilizer</a>, by The Tiffen Company, was successfully funded on March 5th, 2017. I backed at the $139 (early bird) tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steadicam Volt for $60 off the planned $199 retail price</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steadicam Volt Stabilizer</li>
<li>5x magnetic and 1x starter balance weight</li>
<li>2x batteries</li>
<li>battery charger</li>
<li>Micro-USB cable</li>
<li>quickstart guide</li>
<li>carrying pouch</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was June 2017. Because retailers like B&amp;H received Steadicam Volts before backers, we all get a premium carrying case for free. Not bad, but I expected to get the Volt before this month so I could get awesome beach footage of my kids. It&#39;s now the middle of August so that plan was ruined. When companies show prototypes that are <em>super</em> close to the finished product and show they have years of experience doing things, and yadda x3, I expect to get rewards in a relatively short timeframe. Like the Das Keyboard, this is not the case here. Apparently, shipping is supposed to start this month.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2017/09/08 update</p>
<ul>
<li>shipping warehouse is overbooked</li>
<li>shipping will start on the 11th</li>
<li>everyone should get tracking information shortly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2017/09/14 update</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t have tracking info</li>

<h3 id="black-ink-womp"><del>Black Ink</del> WOMP</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-j.jpg" alt="Black Ink on Kickstarter"/></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1750747889/black-ink-people-of-color-in-comics" title="Black Ink on Kickstarter">film</a>, by Craig Rippon, was successfully funded on April 21st, 2017. I backed at the $25 tier for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Heroes Matter t-shirt</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>movie ticket code for advance online screening</li>
<li>my name listed in the &quot;Thank You&quot; section of the film</li>
<li>link to the 2nd trailer for the film when it&#39;s completed</li>
<li>BLACK INK computer wallpaper</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated delivery date was May 2017 (for the t-shirt, not the film) and Craig has been unresponsive.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2017/10/11 update</p>
<ul>
<li>Craig has been dealing with a LOT of family health issues, one of which is serious.</li>
<li>The company he was working with to get the books didn&#39;t honor the apparent discount agreement they had. Maybe time ran out for that?</li>
<li>The film <em>should</em> be out in February.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>2019 May update</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t care anymore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a bit miffed when I didn&#39;t hear anything for months but not anymore, Craig can take all the time he needs.</p>
<h3 id="honorable-mention">Honorable mention</h3>
<p>With the exception of Star Citizen and Indie Microblogging (and as of October 11th, Black Ink), all this has been rather annoying. Honorable mention goes out to Massdrop for the <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-x-mito-canvas-xda-custom-keycap-set" title="MiTo Canvas XDA Custom Keycap Set on Massdrop">MiTo Canvas XDA Custom Keycap Set</a> I&#39;ve yet to receive. The drop completed on February 1st, 2017. I paid $72.97 (shipping included) for the Bauhaus Icon Modifiers and Betas. This is what it&#39;ll look like:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/im-done-with-kickstarter-k.jpg" alt="MiTo Canvas XDA Custom Keycap Set on Massdrop"/></p>
<p>The estimated ship date was June 2nd, 2017 and the new one is now October. <em>Kanye shrug</em> I plan on putting these awesome keys on my existing Das Keyboard...I just noticed I&#39;ll need to purchase <em>additional</em> keys for my number pad.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The moral of this story? It used to be that you could pledge for something on Kickstarter and expect to get the product on or damn close to the promised delivery date. I love the idea of supporting promising businesses but I think I&#39;ll just wait until whatever product is available on Amazon before parting with my money. Who wants to be constantly let down all the time? Not me, not anymore. 🕸</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The name of my company is &quot;Ideas Never Cease&quot; (!NC) because with me, it&#39;s true. Ideas, never <em>ever</em> cease. I am unable to turn my mind off and it has been this way since I was eight. At 29 now, stopping isn&#39;t remotely possible and I like that.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is that...ideas never cease. This means I get super focused on a great idea and work on it for some time and <em>juuuuust</em> when things are starting to get interesting, I get distracted by another great idea and the cycle continues. What does <strong>not</strong> continue, obviously, is progress on those previous ideas...until six months to a full year later. Sometimes, even longer than that!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/neglected-projects-a.jpg" alt="The notebook my fiancé bought for me"/></p>
<p>My fiancé recently bought me a dot grid notebook because it has gold and marble on the cover, which matches <a href="/2017/macbook-pro-review" title="My &#39;MacBook Pro (Late 2016) review&#39;">my laptop</a> a bit. I decided to use that notebook to keep track of my weekly duties and the thought occurred to me to write down my neglected projects. Then I figured I&#39;d share with the world because, why not? I&#39;ve been busy with redesigning <a href="https://beautylynk.com" title="Beauty, on your time">BeautyLynk</a> and building <a href="https://beachfront.digital" title="Easy domain management">BeachfrontDigital</a> so that&#39;s my excuse for not working on these projects.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/neglected-projects-b.jpg" alt="Some of my neglected projects"/></p>
<h3 id="dsgn">DSGN</h3>
<p>I want to start a small web design and development firm so I can make 1) my own hours and 2) more money so I can spend more time on passion projects that I <em>really</em> want to work on and not expect a profit from them. To do that, I need to actually <em>design</em> and code the new <a href="https://dsgn.io" title="My design portfolio, revamp...soon? At some point though, definitely.">website</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that BeautyLynk and BeachfrontDigital will make great initial case studies.</p>
<h3 id="frshbts">FRSH&times;BTS</h3>
<p>Man, I haven&#39;t created music in <em>years</em>. My claim to fame is that when I released &quot;Music from the Love Lounge Vol. 1&quot;, people in Barcelona/Belize were jamming to it. Or at the very least, one person and their friend was. &quot;FRSH&times;BTS&quot; is the production name I go by, &quot;the Wibby&quot; and &quot;Spaceman Fresh&quot; being my rap aliases.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://thewibby.bandcamp.com" title="the Wibby on Bandcamp">my music on Bandcamp</a> at the moment because I never got around to creating the perfect website for <code>frsh.fm</code>. In addition to that, I want to remaster <strong>all</strong> my old work. This means getting a Windows machine, installing Windows 7 and Acid Pro, inspecting the arrangements, and replicating them in Studio One. I have a boatload of tracks in progress that are great jump off points for new songs and I don&#39;t want to lose those. As you can imagine, getting my catalogue remastered is quite the undertaking.</p>
<p><em>Le sigh</em>.</p>
<p>Oh, and I still haven&#39;t released &quot;Waveform&quot;, my debut album. When I listen to it though, the only glaring issues I hear are vocal quality and leveling.</p>
<h3 id="weöm">WEÖM</h3>
<p>Short for &quot;Wisdom Escapes Ordinary Minds&quot;, <a href="https://weom.space" title="Offical site of WEÖM">WEÖM</a> is a space-centric lifestyle brand I started a few years ago. People seem to like the snapback I designed better than the t-shirt and I can understand why. The hat is dope and I wear it everyday!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/neglected-projects-c.jpg" alt="Lakeisha and Sarah wearing WEÖM gear"/></p>
<p>I have done a <em>shitty</em> job of advertising it and generating buzz. Obviously, that&#39;s the only way I&#39;m going to sell all the stock I have but I have a hard time being a salesperson. Ideally, someone else would be doing this for me and taking a cut of the profits. Also, I need to design more products. Again, I have ideas for them but haven&#39;t gone further than sketches.</p>
<h3 id="nc">!NC</h3>
<p>I created a web browser, dubbed &quot;<strong>Aries</strong>&quot;, a few years ago just to see if I could do it and it actually worked. Not only that, but people reached out to me to tell me how much they liked the design and how it worked. Then...I moved onto another project. I was using Opera as my main browser back then and now I&#39;m using Vivaldi but I still have plenty of interesting ideas to challenge the way we think of desktop web browsers.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/neglected-projects-d.png" alt="Aries screenshot"/></p>
<p><strong>Hermes</strong> is the name I&#39;m giving the desktop email client I intend to work on at some point. Back when the latest iPhone was 5, I used a neat mobile email app called &quot;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/05/squareone-for-iphone-organizes-your-email-gives-you-better-control-over-notifications" title="TechCrunch article about SquareOne Mail">SquareOne Mail</a>&quot; and I friggin&#39; <em>loved</em> it. You could train the app to put your email into categories you created so only the <em>most</em> important messages appeared in your inbox. I&#39;ve heard that Gmail can do something similar with filters but I run my own email server. The team behind SquareOne got investors and were persuaded to pivot into something (IMHO quite) boring...I don&#39;t even remember what it was. Anyhoo, Hermes would be an evolved version of the original.</p>
<h3 id="scilab">SciLab</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve saved the best for last. Prepare for a lot of backstory.</p>
<p>If you follow me on social media or other online networks, you may have wondered at some point what a &quot;NetOp&quot; or &quot;NetOperator&quot; is. Well, that comes from a beloved video game series, called &quot;Megaman Battle Network&quot; (MMBN). There are six main games in the series and the timeline is set in the year 20XX...yes, like other Megaman games. In this future, everyone has an A.I. companion called an &quot;Internet Navigator&quot;, or &quot;NetNavi&quot; for short. The people who operate these A.I.s are often referred to as NetOperators. So, combined with my rap alias you read earlier, NetOperator Wibby became my online handle of choice.</p>
<p>Also in this future? A 3D Internet and a futuristic device (Personal Terminal, or PET) that is basically a smartphone. Not so revolutionary-sounding but when the first game came out (2001), it was mind-blowing and captured my imagination. Can you see where I&#39;m going with this? <em>The ideas never ceased.</em></p>
<p>It became quite clear to me that this awesome-sounding future had to exist because...reasons. Like...it&#39;s awesome. But, how was <strong>I</strong> going to make this happen? I was only 13 at the time with a <em>lot</em> of time on my hands. <em>Good grief, I spent 16 years thinking about this stuff</em> 😰</p>
<p>When I (briefly) attended college, I enrolled in Software Engineering for the <strong>sole purpose</strong> of learning how to write an operating system, even if it was from a middle-aged man with <em>impeccable</em> bright white facial hair and a tendency to accidentally spit on students in the front row. However, I was forced to leave because I found out I couldn&#39;t afford college. That dashed my dreams a bit but I taught myself web design and development, got an apprenticeship, and eventually landed good-paying jobs and skills that led me to think, &quot;What if I just...<em>wrote</em> an &#39;operating system&#39; in HTML/CSS/JS?&quot;. This is how <strong><a href="https://hikar.io" title="hikari OS website">hikari OS</a></strong> was born! For those keeping score at home, &quot;hikari&quot; is the creator of the 3D Internet and NetNavis in MMBN. Hey, innovation is a family business.</p>
<p><em>hikari is an Electron app that will be designed to boot from a minimal Linux distro in fullscreen on a Raspberry Pi.</em> It&#39;s like Chrome OS in a way. Anyhoo, I worked on hikari for awhile and got distracted, of course.</p>
<p>For my NetNavi project, I&#39;d need a good voice recognition/synthesis library and currently, Google is the best for that and I don&#39;t consider them an option because they are beyond terrible with user privacy. I&#39;m not sure why they need to store your voice commands on their servers for an unspecified amount of time but hey, that&#39;s what happens when things are free. I&#39;m not expecting my NetNavi project to be considered &quot;real A.I.&quot;. Siri, Cortana, and everything else are just elaborate <code>if</code>/<code>then</code>/<code>else</code> statements. The PET is low priority because the base being a Raspberry Pi makes things super easy (like, creating a dock station, &amp;c).</p>
<p>Lastly, the 3D Internet. In my research, I got downvoted to hell across a couple StackExchange sites (I was told to ask a different site, at least four times). In hindsight, that&#39;s what I get for going there for useful advice.</p>
<p>With regard to &quot;NetCity&quot; in the MMBN anime, I sketched a process that would allow for the automatic generation of buildings based on how deep a website&#39;s links went. Take this site for example! I have four main links in the header. Each of those links would represent a different floor. Each page&#39;s contents would be represented on each floor depending on what it was. Blog posts would become eBooks, mp3s would become a CD, and so on. Just like search engine bots visit your website every now and then, so would this 3D &#39;Net bot and it would report changes that would update your generated building.</p>
<p>This 3D &#39;Net would be accessed via &quot;the Network&quot;, which is effectively an MMORPG where your NetNavi is your avatar. Aries would have a built-in viewer for this, although I&#39;d probably just use three.js.</p>
<p>...This is going off the rails, I understand that. This is also going to cost a <strong>fuck</strong> ton of money. Yes, the fuck was necessary because unless I become super rich in the next 10 years, what I&#39;m seeing in my head will never see the light of day until I&#39;m 60...y&#39;know what, that&#39;s around the age Grandpa Hikari created the Internet. Also, I just realized that he looks like a chubby Vint Cerf.</p>
<h3 id="c">&amp;c</h3>
<p>I could go on and on about my project backlog. Here&#39;s a couple more that are in the incubation stage of my ideation process:</p>
<ul>
<li>social network that doesn&#39;t suck, enables better communication, provides ways for users to deal with harassment, and makes money without selling user data.</li>
<li>an outlet that showcases black excellence, positivity, and training resources to aid small business owners and aspiring freelancers.</li>
<li>an eCommerce platform that allows for true customization, doesn&#39;t treat you like you&#39;re dumb, and has a self-hosted option.</li>
<li>a curated site for lefties that doesn&#39;t look like it was built in 1999 and stayed that way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll get to these projects some day. I&#39;ve attempted to work on things on a schedule but my mind/enthusiasm doesn&#39;t work that way. I&#39;m using a dot grid notebook as a weekly planner instead of the weekly planner I bought months ago, simply because predefined lines and boxes make me feel constrained. I&#39;m not quite sure what the solution is but I think if I had more time (hah, don&#39;t we all want this?) and made my own hours, I could figure this thing out. Or at the very least, start knocking things out one by one. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New logo and an extra login option added to BeachfrontDigital.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="upcoming-features">Upcoming Features</h3>
<p>Over the past month, I&#39;ve gotten great feedback and some users have added a <em>lot</em> of domains to Beachfront. But, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if you could <em>manage</em> your domains? I&#39;m still hard at work on implementing domain purchasing but as I write this I realize it might&#39;ve been better to implement domain <strong>management</strong> first...oh well.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/beachfront-digital-june-update-b.png" alt="Searching for domains on BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<p>In any event, domain management will be pretty easy <em>even if you don&#39;t</em> buy your domains from Beachfront (my pricing isn&#39;t the most competitive at the moment). Adjust your domain&#39;s DNS settings to my dedicated DNS servers and you&#39;ll be able to make further edits from your BD account. Domain renewals and transfers will come after that. And then after <em>that</em>, the real fun starts and I can get started on helping you get rid of domains you don&#39;t need anymore. 😉 This&#39;ll be a multi-tiered strategy/process, stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="continued-improvement">Continued Improvement</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve identified low-hanging fruit thanks to a combination of early feedback and little things I&#39;ve observed here and there. <del>One of these issues is the signup flow for new users. <em>Wouldn&#39;t it be awesome if you were automatically logged in after signing up</em>?</del></p>
<p><del>Another improvement has to do with logging-in as well. By default, you get emailed a link that contains your login token. When clicking that link, a new browser tab opens but now you have two of them to the same site. If this is an issue for you, you will have an option in your account settings to receive just the token itself to copy and paste into the form input that&#39;ll appear on the site.</del></p>
<p><strong>-- 2017/06/29 update start --</strong></p>
<p>New users will get both an intro email <strong>and</strong> a login link in a separate email. I initially wanted the new user to be automatically logged in but wasn&#39;t able to figure out how to do such a thing with Passwordless. So, this is the compromise I came up with. Besides, it&#39;s kinda like verifying one&#39;s account. Right? <em>Right?</em></p>
<p>In your account settings, there&#39;s now an option to choose whether you want to login via a tokenized link (default method) or via copy/pasting a token into the page that pops up on Beachfront if you have that option selected (that was a mouthful).</p>
<p>Options are a beautiful thing to have.</p>
<p><strong>-- 2017/06/29 update end --</strong></p>
<h3 id="logo">Logo!</h3>
<p>Creating icons or logos is not easy and it often takes quite a bit of time for me to 1) think of something, 2) create it, and 3) like the output. I&#39;m pleased to say I&#39;ve done just that for BeachfrontDigital!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/beachfront-digital-june-update-a.jpg" alt="New BeachfrontDigital logo!"/></p>
<p>I started with 48px and worked my way up. In the coming weeks, I&#39;ll update the site and <a href="https://twitter.com/@BeachfrontD" title="BeachfrontDigital on Twitter">Twitter account</a> with it. I like this so much, I feel like I should get some t-shirts made...maybe later this year, haha.</p>
<h3 id="end">End</h3>
<p>And there you have it! My goal is to send at least one newsletter a month to let y&#39;all know how development is going. Stay rad! 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charlamagne Tha God can write a good book. Who knew?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Charlamagne Tha God is a radio personality of a nationally syndicated show called &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; on Power 105.1. He&#39;s not well-liked by most people, especially the people he&#39;s interviewed and has disagreements with — this is because he speaks his mind. He doesn&#39;t like your latest album? He&#39;ll tell you. Are you embroiled in controversy? He&#39;ll ask about it. Basically, he asks the questions or says the things many listeners want to ask or are thinking. I count myself as one of his fans.</p>
<p>When Charlamagne mentioned he was writing a book, I knew I had to check it because...<strong>who the hell would give this man a book deal</strong> (<a href="http://www.simonandschusterpublishing.com/touchstone" title="Touchstone Books">Touchstone Books</a>, apparently)?</p>
<p>While reading, I found myself nodding in agreement when he arrived at the conclusion of a life lesson or when he realized he had to change his thought process. I also couldn&#39;t help noticing similarities in our lives. We loved getting those Pizza Hut coupons for free personal pizzas when we read lots of books in elementary school. Music was a means of both inspiration and escape in our teens. We never finished college. Despite that, we&#39;ve been able to succeed.</p>
<p>I was reminded that I used to live out my &quot;hood dreams&quot; vicariously through artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipse" title="The Clipse on Wikipedia">Clipse</a>. While glamorizing the gangsta life, they also rapped about the obvious downsides. This was at a time when my peers listened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Z">Jay Z</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lox">The Lox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diplomats">Dipset</a>, &amp;c. I was almost exclusively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neptunes">Neptunes</a> and Will Smith. Yes, <em>I know</em>. I was clowned for liking Big Willie&#39;s music throughout all of middle and high school.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, if you&#39;re an aspiring radio host or anyone aspiring to do anything really, I highly recommend this book. The full title is &quot;<a href="http://amzn.to/2qMSdIo" title="Black Privilege on Amazon">Black Privilege: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Create It</a>&quot;. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oh snap, that new new is launched dude!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&#39;m writing this, I just remembered that I planned to launch V2 at the end of April. I did it!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/v2-of-beachfront-digital-is-live-a.png" alt="Landing page for BeachfrontDigital"/><br/><img src="/assets/images/2017/v2-of-beachfront-digital-is-live-b.png" alt="Another landing page shot of BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<p>Please give it an upvote on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/beachfrontdigital" title="BeachfrontDigital on ProductHunt">ProductHunt</a>!</p>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, I&#39;ve been taking in early feedback ranging from UI, UX, and backend issues. As you can imagine, there&#39;s still a lot to do.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a list of what you can currently do as a user:</p>
<ul>
<li>import/export domains (<a href="https://beachfront.digital/downloads/beachfront-digital-import.csv" title="BeachfrontDigital import template">a template is provided</a> for importing).</li>
<li>add domains and registrar/expiration info will automatically get added (in most cases)</li>
<li>add wishlist domains</li>
</ul>
<p>Not a huge list but I think the main draw will be the personal analytics. To my knowledge, no other registrar does this and they <em>certainly</em> don&#39;t allow you to see the domains you have registered elsewhere. Here is what you can expect to see after adding domains:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/v2-of-beachfront-digital-is-live-c.png" alt="Analytical shot of BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<ul>
<li>a conversational readout of your domain portfolio<ul>
<li>total number of domains</li>
<li>number of domains renewing this month</li>
<li>number of domains renewing this year</li>
<li>number of domains renewing next year</li>
<li>total number of TLDs (the text after the period in URLs, <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, <code>.space</code>, &amp;c)</li>
<li>total number of registrars (the companies you buy your domains from)</li>
<li>your favorite registrar</li>
<li>your favorite TLD</li>
<li>total amount of money you&#39;re spending annually to renew your domains</li>
<li>your cheapest domain</li>
<li>your most expensive domain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/v2-of-beachfront-digital-is-live-d.png" alt="Another analytical shot of BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<p>You can also see this data in chart form, which is arguably <em>much</em> more impressive-looking. Currently, the visual data displays:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of domain renewals occurring per month</li>
<li>the amount of money you&#39;re paying per month</li>
<li>the amount of money you pay each registrar per year</li>
<li>the number of domains you&#39;ve registered per registrar</li>
<li>the amount of domains you own per TLD</li>
</ul>
<p>Those screenshots above are from my own domain portfolio and I can gleam some interesting information from the data...</p>
<ul>
<li>I already knew this, but most of my domains come from Tucows, the parent company of Hover.</li>
<li>Three times a year, I seem to get a burst of inspiration and buy domain names. Also, I need to check what month it is before buying something extravagant.</li>
<li>My favorite TLDs are <code>.online</code> and <code>.com</code> (my first domain name was <code>pw-software.com</code> and it&#39;s still live to this day).</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhoo, all this to say that V2 of BeachfrontDigital is live and available at <a href="https://beachfront.digital" title="BeachfrontDigital!">beachfront.digital</a>. Check it out and let me know what you think! 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eliminating friction and adding new features to BeachfrontDigital.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who knew analytics could be fun?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent the past week and a half working on the new <a href="https://beachfront.digital" title="Manage your domain names with Beachfront.Digital!">BeachfrontDigital</a> and I&#39;m loving it. After publishing my <a href="/2017/roadmap-for-beachfront-digital" title="Roadmap for BeachfrontDigital, on theWebb.blog">previous post</a>, I thought about how I could make BD more useful to myself and other people. Something that bothered me for awhile was the lack of importing. <em>To be quite honest</em>, I was scared of the work required to make importing domains work. I just didn&#39;t want to deal with it. <strong>Lame</strong>, right?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a reminder of why nobody bothered to sign up for V1 of BeachfrontDigital:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn&#39;t offering anything that a spreadsheet couldn&#39;t handle.</li>
<li>$6/year was still too much to charge for someone who has &lt;10 domains.</li>
<li>To make charging for my service palatable, I&#39;d need to create a sync system for registrars.<ul>
<li>Not all registrars have public APIs (see: Hover).</li>
<li>There are <strong>so</strong> many registrars. It&#39;s not cost-effective to maintain syncing for each.</li>
<li>Creating a sync system based on undocumented APIs like some people have done with Hover is a <em>terrible</em> idea. Undocumented APIs means they can break at <em>any</em> moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This reminder was enough to get me back into making BD better, starting with CSV importing and guess what? It wasn&#39;t <strong>that</strong> bad! I think it took me two days to get importing to work, with another two for optimization. When a user decides to export their data, it&#39;ll look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/beachfront-digital-april-update-a.png" alt="Snippet of my domain export from BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<h3 id="eliminating-friction">Eliminating friction</h3>
<p>During a coding break, I read an article that was sitting in a tab for at least a week, <a href="http://firstround.com/review/amazons-friction-killing-tactics-to-make-products-more-seamless" title="Amazon article on First Round Review">Amazon&#39;s Friction-Killing Tactics To Make Products More Seamless</a>. What an eye-opener that was! The takeaway I got from it was to <em>minimize as much friction as possible for the end user</em>. It was easy to identify a major point of friction with BD as it was something I was actually dreading. Me, the guy who made the product, didn&#39;t want to perform the basic task. Why? It was too much work!</p>
<p>In V1 of BeachfrontDigital, I had to input the domain name, registrar, price, AND expiration for every single domain I own. Even if the number of domains I had were two, that&#39;s <em>still</em> more work than I&#39;m willing to do. No one likes filling out spreadsheets, it&#39;s a chore. What to do? Automate the hell outta what we don&#39;t want to deal with!</p>
<p>Of course, you&#39;ll have to input your domains because BD is not a mind-reading app (it <em>would be</em> in a few years if it was a Google product). Thankfully, BD will run a WHOIS search in the background and automatically grab registrar and expiration info. Pricing is something you&#39;ll have to input as well because registrars don&#39;t have the same pricing for domains/top-level domains (TLDs).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/beachfront-digital-april-update-b.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my domain portfolio"/></p>
<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on how inconsistent TLD operators are with listing registrar names. In my testing, I found <a href="https://twitter.com/BeachfrontD/status/848404426557673472" title="Screenshot of the hot mess that = TLD operators">three variations</a> of the business name for Tucows. Like, why? Lucky for you, I asked customer support at both Tucows and Hover and was told this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variations in the Tucows name for different domains is simply how it was inputted at the Registry level (each domain extension or tld has a governing entity known as a Registry), and since that is a human&#39;s job normally, it gets added to their system slightly different each time.</p>
<p>— Jordan Q</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, domains purchased through Hover will list the registrar in WHOIS searches as Tucows. Gandi will show EPAG Domainservices GmbH, iwantmyname will show 1API GmbH, and so on. It would be <em>ideal</em> to show the actual reseller you purchased your domains from but that&#39;s not how WHOIS works. Oh well.</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New features</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/beachfront-digital-april-update-c.jpg" alt="Portfolio dashboard for BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<p>This is how the new portfolio dashboard looks! I figured that it&#39;d be good to show personal analytics in both textual and graphical formats. While creating this, I learned how flexible and awesome <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com" title="Build semantic templates without frustration!">Handlebars</a> is.</p>
<p>At a glance, you can see how many domain renewals are occurring this month, this year, and next year. January and July are busy months for me. Interesting that they are six months apart. What is it about those months that give me ideas? I just realized I haven&#39;t accounted for people who renew domains for multiple years...<em>updates list of TODOs</em>.</p>
<p>You can also see how many domains you own per registrar. Obviously, I favor Tucows because I like the included WHOIS privacy from Hover, for domains that support it (I don&#39;t get why <code>.fm</code> and <code>.io</code> don&#39;t, so dumb). I purchased <code>frsh.fm</code> from Gandi initially, but then moved it to Hover. Not sure why EPAG Domainservices GmbH is there...</p>
<p>Finally, you also get to see how many domains you have per TLD. <code>.com</code> and <code>.online</code> are my favorite ones, apparently. The legend for this chart is awfully busy, I&#39;ll need to find a way to make it look better. I mean, someone with 50+ TLDs in their domain portfolio might be an edge-case, but it&#39;s going to bother me until I find a solution, haha. 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>
<p>In order to make every data point stand out, you need color. Well, I wasn&#39;t going to manually create colors, these are all generated dynamically! I need to do a bit of tweaking here and there but I&#39;m mostly satisfied with the results.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>At the end of my <a href="/2017/roadmap-for-beachfront-digital" title="Roadmap for BeachfrontDigital, on theWebb.blog">previous post</a> about BeachfrontDigital, I mentioned making the service free. Hmm, <strong>nope</strong>. However, it <em>will</em> be free during beta, which is whenever I launch V2 until I deem the service is ready for primetime. That could be as early as this summer or as late as 2018. At that point, BeachfrontDigital will cost $11/year afterwards.</p>
<p>What you&#39;ve seen above is only half of the first wave of upgrades. My next BD post will most likely show more charts, but centered around pricing! I&#39;m also thinking about making each of the charts fullscreen-capable. It would be neat to use the left/right arrow keys to look at the other charts in fullscreen mode as well! 🕸</p>

        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2017/nintendo-switch-review"/>
        <updated>2017-03-18T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're gonna wish you weren't on the fence about buying one at launch.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the two weeks since I left GameStop eagerly waiting to get home and unbox my console, the Nintendo Switch has been <strong>such</strong> a joy to use. I waited two weeks to write this review so I could accurately depict how it fits into my everyday. Before I start the review though, I figured I&#39;d run through my launch night.</p>
<h3 id="midnight-launch">Midnight Launch</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-a.jpg" alt="I was the first customer in Boston to get a Switch"/></p>
<p>In an effort to make the midnight launch go as smoothly as possible, GameStop required people to get a receipt with their pre-order earlier in the day and they were numbered so people would know where to stand in line. As people on the Internet say, &quot;FIRST!!1!&quot;. The guy behind me got to the midnight launch before I did and was wondering who had the number one receipt. I thought it was pretty funny.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-b.jpg" alt="Line to the door and then some"/></p>
<p>I went to the midnight launches of the DSi and 3DS. Those launches had <strong>nothing</strong> on this one. When I left, the line was to the door and then some. It was a <em>hella</em> windy night and I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have to wait outside.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-c.jpg" alt="Lucky mofos to snag a Switch"/></p>
<p>The people on the other side of the store didn&#39;t have a pre-order, but they snagged the 13 or so extra Switch consoles this GameStop had for launch. As I waited to get the aforementioned receipt, a couple realized that someone in GameStop allowed those 13 people to reserve the right to buy the limited Switch consoles and the couple were highly upset, to say the least. Apparently, that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen until 6pm. GameStop&#39;s gonna GameStop. 🤷🏾‍♂️</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-d.jpg" alt="Double-sided Zelda poster"/></p>
<p>As a launch bonus, everyone got a free Zelda poster. I should put this up at some point but I&#39;m still unsure about which side I like most. As soon as I got my bag of goodies, I left the store ASAP. I was stopped by someone in line for an impromptu Facebook Live interview. That was weird but two random people know who I am now! Since you got this far, here&#39;s a video:</p>
<h3 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-e.jpg" alt="Such gaming, much fun"/></p>
<h3 id="the-review">The Review</h3>
<p>I didn&#39;t truly appreciate the Wii U&#39;s GamePad until my girlfriend asked me if I was done playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I was hours deep into playing and she had shows to watch. With the press of a button, I <em>switched</em> my attention from the TV to the controller I already had in my hand and walked to my desk a few feet away. Confused, she asked if I was mad at her. Of course I wasn&#39;t, I was still playing Deus Ex! I guess you could say my gameplay was augmented.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Wii U allowed you to swap between the GamePad and the TV for playing most (if not all) games. In a household where there was only one TV at the time, it was amazing.</p>
<p>With the Switch, that appreciation came a helluva lot quicker. I have a roving 10-month-old who likes to wreak havoc and while my girlfriend was gracious enough to let me spend the entire first weekend with the Switch relatively undisturbed, the boy needed to be watched when mom was busy. While playing Zelda, I was asked to watch the boy for a couple minutes so I took the Joy-Con out of the <a href="http://amzn.to/2n522S7" title="Joy-Con Charging Grip on Amazon">charging grip</a> (<em>highly</em> recommended) and onto the sides of the Switch, which I then took out of the dock and walked downstairs. After making myself a human fence to block the boy from roaming elsewhere I continued playing.</p>
<p>Seamless!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-f.jpg" alt="The super portable"/></p>
<p>I bought a Nintendo GameBoy fanny pack from eBay after seeing someone post an old ad for it in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch" title="Nintendo Switch subreddit">/r/NintendoSwitch</a>. I wasn&#39;t sure if the Switch would even fit but it does! You&#39;ll have to detach the Joy-Con, of course. Since the weather is frigid at the moment, I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOLHZpjhE1F" title="Picture of my Revision Path hoodie on Instagram">my hoodie</a>&#39;s pouch to transport my Switch. When the weather gets warmer, the fanny pack will make an appearance. I also have an Animal Crossing bell pouch that I purchased from Etsy but I like the fanny pack more.</p>
<p>I think the <strong>super</strong> portable nature of the Switch is going to make gaming happen in unexpected places, and more often. I&#39;m looking forward to having impromptu Splatoon 2 battles in an airport or Street Fighter II matches in a line for food trucks.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-g.jpg" alt="Charging on the go"/></p>
<p>Being a home console that&#39;s also portable, AAA-type games like the new Zelda consume a LOT of power. As a result, the battery life isn&#39;t great (I&#39;ve gotten roughly three hours of Zelda gameplay on a single charge). It doesn&#39;t seem that much different from the battery life of a 3DS when playing Super Smash Bros. You&#39;ll get a notification that the battery level is low but I usually ignore that until I see it a second time. If I&#39;m in transit, I use my <a href="http://amzn.to/2mFFy6R" title="Anker PowerCore+ on Amazon">Anker charger</a> to keep gaming.</p>
<p>For me, the battery life hasn&#39;t been an issue and that&#39;s because I have a <a href="/2017/macbook-pro-review">laptop with USB-C charging</a>. Whether I&#39;m at home or at work, I <em>always</em> have a charger (I bought two because I kept leaving my then sole charger at home). The addition of yet another popular device with USB-C charging in the global marketplace makes me confident that the future of a single port for <del>all</del> most electronics will come to fruition relatively soon. Early adopters like myself have to deal with buying temporary plugadoos and such but hey, that&#39;s so <strong>you</strong> don&#39;t have to!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-h.jpg" alt="An excellent purchase decision"/></p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t sure if I would come to regret buying <a href="http://amzn.to/2n4lUVx" title="Surge Nintendo Switch Grip Kit on Amazon">grips</a> for the Joy-Con but after a <strong>single</strong> Snipperclips play session, I can honestly say it was a <em>fantastic</em> purchase decision. The Joy-Con feel decent without it but with my Jack Skellington-esque fingers, I definitely appreciated the classic controller feel of the grips. My girlfriend has much smaller hands and will not play Snipperclips without them.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-i.jpg" alt="Love the build quality"/></p>
<p>The build quality of the Switch is awesome. It&#39;s also incredibly light, suspiciously so. You&#39;d think it&#39;d weigh more for what it does. The kickstand on the back is plastic and detachable. It&#39;s designed to be easily replaceable and that&#39;s awesome because it would suck if you had to replace the console because of it.</p>
<p>There are fan vents on the top of the device and it occurred to me after week one of owning it that I&#39;ve never heard fan noise. When I&#39;ve thought to touch the top of it during a lengthly play session I did feel heat and had to put the Switch up to my ear to hear fan noise. I&#39;ve had a screen protector since day one and somehow let an errant wisp of fabric get in but I don&#39;t care enough to fix that niggling issue.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-j.png" alt="dbrand skin for Nintendo Switch"/></p>
<p>I&#39;m sad that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5xc5si/warning_do_not_skin_your_nintendo_switch">dbrand won&#39;t be making Switch skins</a>. This is the design I came up with, to match the awesome marble skin on my <a href="/2017/macbook-pro-review">MacBook Pro</a>. Welp. At least dbrand is an awesome company.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/nintendo-switch-review-k.jpg" alt="Great interface"/></p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken so many screenshots of the interface (except in eShop, that&#39;s not possible there) and I&#39;ve got one request for Nintendo. <em>Please</em> make it possible to hide the UI in games when taking screenshots! I complained about this to <a href="https://twitter.com/jessety" title="Jesse Youngblood on Twitter">@jessety</a> and he informed me that you can hide most of the UI in Zelda (you&#39;ll just see your heart containers). I just hope more games adopt the &quot;Pro HUD&quot; option that Zelda provides.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll end this review with the real reason I bought a Switch: Splatoon 2! If you hadn&#39;t guessed by the decal on the back of my Switch, I&#39;m a <strong>huge</strong> fan of the original for Wii U. 🕸</p>

        <id>https://blog.webb.page/2017/roadmap-for-beachfront-digital</id>
        <link href="https://blog.webb.page/2017/roadmap-for-beachfront-digital"/>
        <updated>2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Far-reaching goals for BeachfrontDigital.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://beachfront.digital" title="Manage your domain names with Beachfront.Digital!">BeachfrontDigital</a> is a domain portfolio management tool I built and launched late last year. To quote the &quot;About&quot; page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BeachfrontDigital is me scratching my own itch and taking cues from The 7 Day Startup. I buy domains on a regular basis and often from more than one registrar. As a result, I tend to forget I have some domains! <strong>True story</strong>, I ran a WHOIS search <em>on a domain I own</em>, a couple months ago. Terrible. 😩</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name is a result of a conversation I had with co-workers about how domain names are like the premium waterfront properties of the 80s. Of course, the domain <code>beachfront.digital</code> was available so I snagged it ASAP.</p>
<p>Since launching BD in October, I&#39;ve made updates here and there and it seemed like I was going to get valuable feedback from early beta testers who assured me they would sign up at $6/year <em>instead of</em> the regular $11/year price...turns out, <strong>nobody</strong> wanted to beta test and my messages were ignored. Was it because of the upfront cost? Was it because I didn&#39;t have a bunch of features fleshed out? I&#39;ll never know. However, of the friends I reached out to for feedback <a href="https://twitter.com/dubstrike" title="Wojtek on Twitter">Wojtek Witkowski</a> was the only one who got back to me. Through him and a prospective customer/commenter on Hacker News, I learned a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn&#39;t offering anything that a spreadsheet couldn&#39;t handle.</li>
<li>$6/year was still too much to charge for someone who has &lt;10 domains.</li>
<li>To make charging for my service palatable, I&#39;d need to create a sync system for registrars.<ul>
<li>Not all registrars have public APIs (see: Hover).</li>
<li>There are <strong>so</strong> many registrars. It&#39;s not cost-effective to maintain syncing for each.</li>
<li>Creating a sync system based on undocumented APIs like some people have done with Hover is a <em>terrible</em> idea. Undocumented APIs means they can break at <em>any</em> moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons and more, <em>I have decided to make BeachfrontDigital free</em> when V2 goes live. I&#39;m currently working on a stock photography site for people of color so upgrades and changes to BD will occur in March (when I&#39;m not playing my Nintendo Switch, hehe). I also plan to update the site with a visual style reminiscent of the 80s. Here&#39;s how the site used to look:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/roadmap-for-beachfront-digital-a.png" alt="First version of BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it looks now:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/roadmap-for-beachfront-digital-b.png" alt="Second version of BeachfrontDigital"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the styling went from pretty cool (the logo was levitating and the background grid moved as well) to extremely sterile. Nothing&#39;s <em>wrong</em> with a sterile look, that&#39;s what this blog looks like, haha! But for something with the URL <code>beachfront.digital</code>, it could stand to look a <strong>bit</strong> more impressive.</p>
<p>A key missing feature is the ability to import your domains. If you&#39;ve already got a method to organize your domains and you want to use BeachfrontDigital, you sure wouldn&#39;t want to type everything again right? <strong>Hell no</strong>, who has time for <em>that</em>?! I intend to make the wishlist feature more robust, as well as the personal analytics. For example, I&#39;m paying $2027 for 75 domains per year 😅. Anyhoo, watch this space and <a href="https://twitter.com/@BeachfrontD" title="BeachfrontDigital on Twitter">@BeachfrontD</a> on Twitter for updates. 🕸</p>

        <updated>2017-02-07T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyberpunk is my favorite genre for a reason.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading William Gibson&#39;s <em>Neuromancer</em> I knew I had to read <em>Count Zero</em>. Once it picked it up, it was difficult to put down.</p>
<p>There are four different story arcs that eventually culminate in a satisfying climax. What does a wannabe hotshot <del>hacker</del> cowboy, a disgraced historian, an <strong>extremely</strong> rich and dying man, and a hitman for hire all have in common? Well, you&#39;re gonna have to read <em>Count Zero</em> to figure out for yourself (I&#39;m <em>assuming</em> you don&#39;t want spoilers). There is a lot to love about this sci-fi novel and I hope it becomes a movie someday.</p>
<p>Something that stood out to me was continued references to &quot;the matrix&quot;. <em>Count Zero</em> was printed in 1986 (before I was alive!) and because this book is <strong>so</strong> inventive and fascinating, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Wachowski siblings point to it as inspiration for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)" title="The Matrix franchise on Wikipedia">Matrix film trilogy</a>. There are also references to &quot;decks&quot;, which appear to be the interface through which cowboys access the matrix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell" title="Ghost in the Shell on Wikipedia">Ghost in the Shell</a> style. I imagine they look like the computer Sam Flynn used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy" title="Tron: Legacy on Wikipedia">Tron: Legacy</a> to access the Grid.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/count-zero-review-a.jpg" alt="Sam Flynn in Tron: Legacy"/></p>
<p>Gibson has an interesting writing style that evokes a sense of longing for the future, which is bizarre considering the book is older than myself. However, as forward-thinking as most concepts are, some of his writing is dated. Not too much to take you out of his world, but just enough to make one think, &quot;Wow, this would be incredible when updated for a film&quot;.</p>
<p>What I <em>didn&#39;t like</em> was his way of switching to another character&#39;s storyline at the beginning of most chapters and taking (what I felt was) far too long to let you know who the new focus was on. This forced me to re-read the beginning of several chapters in order to get the characters&#39; inner voices to make sense in their respective environments. I don&#39;t know about you, but I mentally create voices for characters in novels based on their initial descriptions.</p>
<p>Like many futuristic books, this one explores corporate espionage, suspect scientific morals, the disillusionment of the rich, &amp;c. Just fascinating stuff especially as the world seems to go in this direction IRL.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2kBWrzZ" title="Buy Count Zero on Amazon">Count Zero</a> is Paul-approved. 🕸</p>

        <updated>2017-01-25T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Living to work versus working to live.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently read an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sweden-six-hour-working-day-too-expensive-scrapped-experiment-cothenburg-pilot-scheme-a7508581.html" title="Link to an article by The Independent">article</a> about Sweden&#39;s six-hour work day and was fascinated by it because here in the States, it&#39;s more about the <em>quantity</em> of hours you put in, it&#39;s not about the <em>quality</em> of the work you put in (FWIW, that seems to be changing in start-up land). Henry Ford famously tested the eight-hour work day with his factory employees, but it&#39;s 2017 now. Do we <em>really</em> need to continue the trend?</p>
<p>To <a href="https://brath.com/why-we-started-with-6-hour-work-days" title="Link to an article by Brath">quote</a> Magnus Bråth of Brath, a tech company in Sweden (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also believe that once you&#39;ve gotten used to having time for the family, picking up the kids at day care, spending time training for a race or simply just cooking good food at home, you don&#39;t want to lose that again. We believe that this is a good reason to stay with us and not only because of the actual impact longer hours would make in your life but for the reason behind our shorter days. That we have shorter days is not the main reason people stay with us, they are the symptom of the reason. The reason is that we actually care about our employees, <strong>we care enough to prioritize their time with the family, cooking or doing something else they love doing</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A third huge reason for shorter days is that we all feel more rested. Obviously we too have to stay late at times, obviously we too are stressed at times but it&#39;s from a better base line. Working late at our two offices often mean staying for 8 hours, or 7. <strong>Think about it, when mom comes home late, she comes home at 5.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the linked article at the top of this post, the six-hour work day experiment ended because it was too expensive for the nursing home it was tested in. Nurses were more alert and as a result, <strong>care and happiness amongst those being cared for increased</strong> drastically. <em>However</em>, more nurses were hired to provide overlap for shifts. As countries become more wealthy, I think the benefits will outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>I look forward to implementing a similar system when I am able to hire people for <a href="https://the-inc.co" title="Link to !NC">Ideas Never Cease</a>. Better maternity / paternity / grief leave as well! A previous employer didn&#39;t seem to give a damn while I was grieving over my miscarried daughter Zoe Elise and that added to the hurt, immensely. I don&#39;t <em>ever</em> want to make someone else feel the way I felt, it sucked. My grief was getting in the way of your <strong>false deadline</strong> on a project for your <strong>still breathing</strong> family member? Whoops, <em>my bad</em>. 🙄 But I digress.</p>
<p>Chantal Panozzo wrote a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/8974435/switzerland-work-life-balance" title="Link to an article for Vox">great article for Vox</a> detailing her life in Switzerland and the amazing adjustment from American work life. Here are a few choice quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Switzerland, you don&#39;t arrive to a meeting late, but you also don&#39;t leave for your lunch break a second past noon. If it&#39;s summer, jumping into the lake to swim with the swans is an acceptable way to spend your lunch hour. If you eat a sandwich at your desk, people will scold you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lunchtime is sacred time in Switzerland. When I was on maternity leave, my husband came home for lunch to help me care for our daughter. This strengthened our marriage. Many families still reunite during weekdays over the lunch hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Swiss law mandates a 14-week maternity leave at a minimum of 80 percent pay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People in Europe took vacation seriously. Once, when I only took 10 days for a trip to Spain, my colleagues chastised me for taking so little time off. I learned to take vacation chunks in two-week intervals. Well rested, I noticed that I felt more productive and creative when I returned to work. Recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/opinion/sunday/relax-youll-be-more-productive.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;&amp;gwh=AC034D10F64239B961A6E1CDE12C9332&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=opinion" title="Link to an article by the New York Times">American research</a> confirms what I was feeling: Relaxing can make you <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/7/22/5912369/creativity-vacation-work-office" title="Link to an article by Vox">more productive</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could continue, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>With self-imposed deadlines, I find that I am more creative in my problem-solving and often find better solutions than if I was working on problems without a time-sensitive goal attached. I believe the same thing would be applied to a shorter work day. A six-hour work day would also discourage long meetings without focus (well, long meetings <em>period</em>). I don&#39;t see big American companies making these quote drastic changes but startups? Hell yeah, definitely. Instead of focusing on &quot;perks&quot; like beer on tap, foosball tables, and game systems, &amp;c, why not focus on improving the lives of your employees so they can make dope shit?</p>
<p>Happy employees will reward you with their absolute best work. Simple. 🕸</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: If you aren&#39;t already a Mac user in the market for a new laptop, then this isn&#39;t for you. If you <strong>are</strong> in the market <em>or</em> would like to see how I view my new computer, read on!</p>
<h3 id="the-adapter-problem">The adapter &quot;problem&quot;</h3>
<p>I can understand why a lot of people are complaining about the dongles, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/682/in-which-we-try-to-rebrand-the-dongle" title="The origin of my new favorite word">plugadoo</a>s, throughports, &amp;c, but I don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m seeing these complaints from people who would <strong>never</strong> buy a computer from Apple. Quite frankly, it reads as bullshit and an excuse to complain on the Internet.</p>
<p>I have two plugadoos and I backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hypershop/hyperdrivetm-compact-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-hub-for-m" title="HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C Hub for 2016 MacBook Pro">another one</a> on Kickstarter. I haven&#39;t decided which one will stay at home and which one will stay in my bag yet (the Kickstarter one has more ports than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J4BO0X8" title="Amazon link to Satechi&#39;s multi-port adapter">Satechi multi-port adapter</a> I&#39;m currently using). The transition period is <strong>always</strong> annoying but once <em>everyone</em> is in this USB-C future, no one will be complaining. To borrow Edison Wrzosek&#39;s response to a <a href="https://disqus.com/home/discussion/9to5maccom/majority_of_readers_say_no_big_deal_adapting_to_usb_c_world_of_new_macbook_pro/#comment-3066707705">9to5Mac article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah, people have such short term memory... I still remember when Apple transitioned people, almost overnight, to USB-only iMac&#39;s, at a time when USB was nicknamed the &quot;U-Son-of-a-Bitch&quot; port in the PC world due to compatibility, reliability issues, and lack of supported peripherals. Now look at USB, it&#39;s supplanted almost EVERY other standard.</p>
<p>People just LOVE to whine and complain, and it&#39;s Human nature to abhor change, and be fearful of it. TB3/USB3.1 is the future, and it&#39;s here and now. Time to embrace it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still gonna rock my 2011 MBP for a while longer, but I&#39;m really looking forward to a ubiquitous standard cable for ALL connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <strong>really</strong> wish &quot;U-Son-of-a-Bitch&quot; port stuck, unofficially. That sounds hilarious.</p>
<h3 id="battery-life">Battery life</h3>
<p>Trash.</p>
<p>Charging? Hella quick. It&#39;s a great compromise IMO. That and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m using my computer like a normal person. It&#39;s not uncommon for me to be running several browser windows with tabs that are almost too small, while compressing a 1 GB folder of images, in addition to running local servers (not sure if this last part is applicable to power consumption).</p>
<p>Basically, it&#39;s <em>meh</em>. Could be better. I should&#39;ve tested this to be certain, but I think my average is ~3 hours at max brightness.</p>
<h3 id="magsafe">MagSafe</h3>
<p><em>Sigh</em></p>
<p>I <strong>loved</strong> MagSafe because life is unpredictable. I&#39;ve walked into my charge cable too many times to count and I never had to worry about my laptop flying to the floor. Because I shouldn&#39;t have nice things, I&#39;ve done the same thing with my new MacBook Pro and it stayed on the table! The charge puck fell out of the wall instead, thankfully.</p>
<p>Speaking of the charge puck, another complaint I&#39;ve heard is in regard to the retractable arms on the old charge puck. In practice, the absence of them is <em>not</em> a big deal. To store my charge cable and puck in my bag, I just fold and tie the cable while it&#39;s still plugged into the puck. I&#39;m not focused on making my cable storage pretty while I&#39;m in transit.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/macbook-pro-review-a.jpg" alt="Not sure what the big deal is..."/></p>
<h3 id="the-screen">The screen</h3>
<p>Good grief this thing is bright, <em>and I like it</em>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m the kind of person who keeps the brightness on his phone to maximum so when I heard that this computer&#39;s brightness and color gamut was increased/enhanced, I was excited. Colour is such a huge part of my life, <a href="http://www.brisseaux.com/retro-series" title="Kervin Brisseaux&#39;s &#39;Retro Series&#39; artwork. Fucking badass.">I get inspired</a> by it. In certain lighting conditions, I <strong>do</strong> turn the brightness down though. I&#39;m not an animal!</p>
<h3 id="the-esc-key-or-lack-thereof">The ESC key, or lack thereof</h3>
<p>Two weeks in and I&#39;m still confused when I need to use it. Albeit only for a split second but it&#39;s enough to give me pause and think, &quot;That&#39;s weird&quot;, before continuing with whatever I was doing. Currently, the only time I use it is when cancelling a screenshot in progress, dismissing autocomplete keywords in Atom, or exiting an iTunes visualization or whatever else is in fullscreen mode.</p>
<p>Before I&#39;ve experienced this for myself, I heard developers (who also didn&#39;t have the computer to even try it) say they wouldn&#39;t be able to do programming on it. Maybe I&#39;m just a simple man because all I do is code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but if you <strong>need</strong> to use a physical ESC key to get things done you might have other issues or a hella interesting programming environment  (if I&#39;m wrong, <a href="https://twitter.com/@NetOpWibby" title="My Twitter account">let me know</a>).</p>
<h3 id="the-touch-bar-and-function-keys">The Touch Bar and Function keys</h3>
<p>This thing is neat. My most-used &quot;keys&quot; are volume up/down. Sliding the volume level is much more satisfying than repeatedly tapping a button. I know, that sounds weird to say but it&#39;s true! There&#39;s more granularity too. I&#39;ve slid the volume down to where the on-screen display says the volume is effectively off but I can still hear audio. With the old function keys, volume was changeable in steps.</p>
<p>Something to get used to is doing hard refreshes in my browser. I have Vivaldi setup to do a hard refresh to clear the cache sometimes and that keyboard shortcut is <code>Shift + F5</code>. Well, I don&#39;t have my Touch Bar setup to show me the function row by default so my shortcut (when not using an external keyboard) is <code>Fn + Shift + F5</code>.</p>
<p>The Touch Bar changes based on whatever app you&#39;re using, which is great. However, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever used it for an app besides iTunes. When editing the photo of how I tie my charge cable, I saw this in the Touch Bar (using <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo" title="Great photo-editing tool for Mac and PC">Affinity Photo</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/macbook-pro-review-b.png" alt="Neat-o"/></p>
<h3 id="touch-id">Touch ID</h3>
<p>Like with the iPhone, you have to input your password <a href="01.png" title="UGH">when cold booting</a> but in-between cold boots, it&#39;s wonderful to use a single finger press to unlock my computer.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/macbook-pro-review-c.png" alt="Mmm, dat sweet Touch ID"/></p>
<p>How much time do we spend typing passwords? Who knows, but <em>my</em> time doing so has decreased dramatically in part to Touch ID. The other reason for my (almost) no password typing life? 1Password.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/macbook-pro-review-d.png" alt="1Password is life"/></p>
<p>You&#39;d need to type in your Master Password to unlock it but now you don&#39;t! It&#39;s <em>even less</em> of a hassle to use an already hassle-free product for personal security. I don&#39;t know 90% of my passwords.</p>
<h3 id="the-keyboard">The keyboard</h3>
<p>I thought I would <strong>hate</strong> the keyboard due to the short travel. This was based upon my previous experience of typing on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook" title="Some people LOVE this MacBook. Too limited for me though.">MacBook</a> One (that&#39;s not the real name, but it&#39;s the MacBook with only one port) in an Apple Store once. Might as well be typing on a screen! I believe I was listening to ATP when I heard Marco Arment talk about the keyboard travel on the MacBook Pro I typed this post on, and he spoke highly of it. That made me feel better about purchasing this and in everyday use, I enjoy it. Typing doesn&#39;t sound particularly loud to me (this is another complaint I&#39;ve heard). Maybe this is because I own a Das Keyboard? 🤔</p>
<p>The <strong>only</strong> gripe I have is with the new arrow keys. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOV3YBjBJdV" title="I still get tripped up by these">WTF</a>. Someone coming to MacBooks without prior usage would acclimate faster, I think.</p>
<h3 id="the-trackpad">The trackpad</h3>
<p>Dayum.</p>

<p>The trackpad is nearly as big as my Magic Trackpad. As a former <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/mice/arc-touch-mouse/rvf-00052" title="My previous favorite mouse, from Microsoft">external-mouse</a>-only guy, I can say that 1) having a big surface for multi-gesture controls is awesome and 2) it&#39;s even better when it&#39;s on a laptop. Even with the <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/apple-macbook-pro-15-skins-2016-touch-bar" title="I have the matte black trackpad skin">dbrand skin</a> I have on it, the trackpad is super responsive. My palms aren&#39;t typically on the trackpad when I&#39;m typing but when they are, the palm rejection is great.</p>
<h3 id="usb-c">USB-C</h3>
<p>I saved the best for last.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about the <em>glory</em> that is USB-C.</p>
<p>You know when you&#39;re outside on a <em>sweltering</em> hot day, and your sweat betrays you and only makes you warmer? Okay, picture that. Now, picture that you&#39;ve just been given one of those red, white, and blue popsicle rockets. You bite off a bit and your body thanks you by cooling you down and you feel that elation of peace and tranquility and your mood improves by 10 notches.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how I felt when I needed to charge my computer and I realized that I could do so FROM ANY PORT FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE COMPUTER. <strong>MAN</strong>. I&#39;m mobile with my laptop of course, and I like taking it to the living room while the family is watching TV or hanging out, &amp;c. Typically, I was forced to sit in certain spots if my computer needed charging. Now, the <strong>world</strong> is my oyster. It doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal but trust me, it <em>is</em>.</p>
<h3 id="fin">FIN</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/macbook-pro-review-g.jpg" alt="Shot of the outside of my MacBook Pro"/></p>
<p>In conclusion, I will say that this computer was a fantastic upgrade for me. It even survives water getting splashed on it! Not saying I&#39;ve ever done that recently, it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve heard about… 👀 Of course, I&#39;m going to feel some type of way <del>if</del>when Apple refreshes this laptop later this year but it&#39;s okay. I like getting glimpses of the future when I can. This computer is 0.5 pounds lighter than the previous generation and I can definitely tell. I&#39;m a happy customer.</p>
<p>All that&#39;s left for Apple to do now is make everything super energy efficient, crazily so. Oh, and fix software bugs. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Setting myself up for failure by making a public promise to read a long-ass list of books.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My girlfriend and I are in competition to see who can read the most books this year. Before going through my list, let&#39;s have a look at my bookshelf.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/books-i-plan-to-read-this-year-a.jpg" alt="My bookshelf has more than books on it"/></p>
<p>As you can see, I have a <strong>lot</strong> going on. Eagle-eyed observers will see that some books have red dot stickers on them. Those are there to symbolize which books I have not read yet, or <em>started</em> but haven&#39;t finished. In alphabetical order, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><del><em>1984</em> — George Orwell</del> <a href="/2017/1984-review">review</a></li>
<li><em>The 48 Laws of Power</em> — Robert Greene</li>
<li><em>A Culture of Innovation: Insider accounts of computing and life at BBN</em> — David Walden and Raymond Nickerson</li>
<li><em>The Art of Profitability</em> — Adrian Slywotzky</li>
<li><em>The Art of the Start</em> — Guy Kawasaki</li>
<li><em>Astronomy 101</em> — Carolyn Collins Petersen</li>
<li><em>Brave New World</em> — Aldous Huxley</li>
<li><em>Bring the Outdoors In</em> — Shane Powers and Gentl &amp; Hyers</li>
<li><em>Business Model Generation</em> — Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur</li>
<li><em>The Cold Between</em> — Elizabeth Bonesteel</li>
<li><em>Connectography</em> — Parag Khanna</li>
<li><em>Cosmos</em> — Carl Sagan</li>
<li><del><em>Count Zero</em> — William Gibson</del> <a href="/2017/count-zero-review">review</a></li>
<li><em>Designing News</em> — Francesco Franchi</li>
<li><em>Easy Origami</em> — John Montroll</li>
<li><em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> — Brian Greene</li>
<li><em>Getting Things Done</em> — David Allen</li>
<li><em>HOLO 2</em> — Various Artists/Writers</li>
<li><em>Humans Of New York stories</em> — Brandon Stanton</li>
<li><em>Illuminations: Wisdom From This Planet&#39;s Greatest Minds</em> — Illuminatiam</li>
<li><em>Isaac Newton&#39;s Principia Mathematica Reissue</em> — Kronecker Wallis</li>
<li><em>The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047</em> — Lionel Shriver</li>
<li><em>The Mission Chinese Food Cookbook</em> — Danny Bowien and Chris Ying</li>
<li><em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em> — William Gibson</li>
<li><em>NASA Graphic Standards Manual reissue</em> — Jesse Reed &amp; Hamish Smyth</li>
<li><em>The Nature of Code</em> — Daniel Shiffman</li>
<li><em>NES/Famicom: a visual compendium</em> — Sam Dyer</li>
<li><em>NLP: The New Technology of Achievement</em> — NLP Comprehensive and Steve Andreas</li>
<li><em>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</em> — Andrew S Tanenbaum and Albert S Woodhull</li>
<li><em>A People&#39;s History of the United States</em> — Howard Zinn</li>

<li><em>The Secret Recipes</em> — Dominique Ansel</li>
<li><em>Selling the Invisible</em> — Harry Beckwith</li>
<li><em>Snowcrash</em> — Neal Stephenson</li>
<li><em>Space Chronicles</em> — Neil deGrasse Tyson</li>
<li><em>Universal Principles of Design</em> — William Lidwell and Kritina Holden</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s 38 books in total. Of those, two of them aren&#39;t actually in my possession <em>yet</em>. <em>Isaac Newton&#39;s Principia Mathematica Reissue</em> and <em>NES/Famicom: a visual compendium</em> are both Kickstarter-backed books that should be delivered sometime this year.</p>
<p>To hold myself accountable <strong>and</strong> make sure I retain the information I read, I&#39;m going to do book reports on this blog which will basically be reviews. My girlfriend is going to do the same thing on <a href="http://sincerelyshantelle.com" title="My girlfriend&#39;s blog, &ldquo;Sincerely Shantelle&rdquo;">her blog</a>, so be sure to check that out.</p>
<p>I am most excited to read <em>Count Zero</em> and <em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em> because I absolutely <strong>love</strong> <em>Neuromancer</em> (all three of these books were written by William Gibson). I&#39;ve read it a few times already. Funny story, while still in high school I visited a Border&#39;s bookstore (RIP) to buy Neuromancer. The store clerk thought I said &quot;New Romancer&quot; and wasted 10 minutes trying to find the incorrect book. In hindsight, I&#39;m surprised that wasn&#39;t a real book in the store.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, the book I am reading right now is <em>A Culture of Innovation: Insider accounts of computing and life at BBN</em>. I am <strong>fascinated</strong> about the beginnings of the Internet. To think that it didn&#39;t always exist and now it&#39;s in the very fabric of our lives thanks in part to the people at <em>Bolt Beranek and Newman</em> is so cool to me. 🕸</p>

        <updated>2016-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking back on the awesome things that's happened to me in 2016.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I decided to <a href="https://2016.dsgn.io/thoughts/post/what-ive-achieved-in-2015" title="What I&#39;ve achieved in 2015">look back</a> on everything I&#39;ve learned/achieved and it was a great reflective experience. So, here it is again for 2016!</p>
<h3 id="became-a-father-to-a-newborn">Became a father to a newborn</h3>
<p>I was already a dad but I&#39;ve never experienced taking care of a <em>brand new</em> life. I was worried that my son wouldn&#39;t like me and other silly non-sensical things like that. In reality, it is <strong>super</strong> challenging at times but he&#39;s a happy boy who has no problem falling asleep in my arms. And biting me. And farting on me. Needless to say, he&#39;s super comfortable with his papa. 😁</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2016/what-ive-achieved-this-year-a.jpg" alt="Ian Asher and I"/></p>
<h3 id="moved-all-my-projects-to-gitlab">Moved all my projects to GitLab</h3>
<p>After running my own email server for half a year, I wondered why I was <em>still</em> paying GitHub for private repos. What they <del>charged</del> used to charge didn&#39;t make sense so I set up a <a href="https://paulwebb.software" title="Paul Webb Software link">personal GitLab instance</a> and I couldn&#39;t be happier. I have unlimited private repos for <strong>$40/month</strong> (my server has <strong>4GB of RAM</strong> and <strong>60GB of storage</strong>). Because you can never be too sure, I have backups enabled for <strong>$8/month</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="moved-all-my-email-to-mail-in-a-box">Moved all my email to Mail-in-a-Box</h3>
<p>Just like with GitHub, I didn&#39;t understand why I was paying Hover $200/year for hosting my email when I <em>already</em> had a <a href="https://mailinabox.email" title="Mail-in-a-Box link">Mail-in-a-Box</a> instance hosting <a href="https://thenetwork.email" title="My main email address">one</a> of my them. Thankfully, it&#39;s <a href="https://mailinabox.email/maintenance.html#multiple-domains" title="Adding multiple domains to one MiaB instance tutorial">relatively easy</a> to add multiple domains to the same box. It currently costs me <strong>$10/month</strong> for <em>unlimited</em> email accounts versus $200/year for merely 10 (my server has <strong>1GB of RAM</strong> and <strong>30GB of storage</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="released-a-saas-product">Released a SaaS product</h3>
<p>I buy a lot of books on Amazon and never get around to reading them. That wasn&#39;t the case with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Day-Startup-Learn-Until-Launch/dp/1502472392" title="The 7 Day Startup on Amazon">The 7 Day Startup</a>. After reading the book (it was a quick read), I was super motivated to bring an idea (I sat on for about a year) to life. That idea was <a href="https://beachfront.digital" title="My domain portfolio management tool">BeachfrontDigital</a>, a domain portfolio management tool. My market focus is quite niche, it&#39;s for people who buy multiple domains from multiple registrars. The problem I am solving involves keeping track of all your domains and renewal dates. Some TLDs also renew 30 days before expiration and I intend to include this kind of information in V2. I&#39;ve gotten some great feedback and I look forward to enhancing the service in 2017.</p>
<p>Related to releasing BeachfrontDigital, I learned how to use <a href="http://feathersjs.com" title="Feathers.js site link">Feathers.js</a> more, used <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" title="MongoDB site link">MongoDB</a> and <a href="http://mongoosejs.com" title="mongoose site link">mongoose</a> for the first time, and in production (I love them both now), and other back-end web development things. I&#39;m a firm believer that side projects are key to learning new things. Your day job most likely won&#39;t challenge you to try drastically different things from what you&#39;re used to, which can stifle your personal growth.</p>
<h3 id="hosted-my-first-pop-up-shop">Hosted my first pop-up shop</h3>
<p>My clothing brand <a href="https://weom.space" title="My space-centric clothing brand site">WEÖM</a> had a pop-up shop in one of WeWork South Station&#39;s conference rooms. Along with my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angel_garc" title="Angel Garcia on Instagram">Angel</a>, we had fun collaborating on 2017 collections when we weren&#39;t chatting with people who stopped by. It was a <strong>great</strong> learning experience! In the time since, I&#39;ve decided to transition/rebrand WEÖM to become a space-centric lifestyle brand instead of being <em>just</em> a clothing brand. There&#39;s still a lot of work to be done, but look forward to visiting the new world I&#39;m building around it!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2016/what-ive-achieved-this-year-b.jpg" alt="Bridget rocking the signature snapback"/></p>
<h3 id="had-my-first-interview">Had my first interview</h3>
<p><a href="http://revisionpath.com" title="Revision Path website link">Revision Path</a> is a weekly interview podcast, <a href="https://patreon.com/revisionpath" title="Revision Path on Patreon">Patreon</a>, and <a href="https://revisionpath.herokuapp.com" title="Revision Path on Slack">Slack group</a> that I&#39;ve been a fan of for quite some time. The host, <a href="https://twitter.com/mauricecherry" title="Maurice Cherry on Twitter">Maurice Cherry</a>, likes to interview people on the come up doing interesting things. So, imagine my surprise when he asked to interview <strong>me</strong>! We tried recording while I was in my apartment but houses in Massachusetts are old so my microphone was picking AM radio signals. 😒 I wasn&#39;t hearing that weirdness but Maurice is in Atlanta and was hearing ads for Harvard, lol! Long story short, we had to reschedule and the interview will be out in January. <strong>Great</strong> way to start off the new year!</p>
<h3 id="published-my-first-module-to-npm">Published my first module to npm</h3>
<p>My module is called <code>hexo-render-sass</code> and I made it before realizing that similar modules exist...oh well (it doesn&#39;t help that the official <a href="https://hexo.io/plugins" title="Hexo plugins page">Hexo site</a> fails to list Sass plugins on the site). It was another great learning experience and it took away the mystic mumbo jumbo I associated npm modules with. You can <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-render-sass" title="My module on npm">find it here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="and-thats-it">And that&#39;s it!</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll end this post with my best nine Instagram photos of 2016, according to <a href="https://2016bestnine.com" title="Find your best 9 photos on Instagram">Lip Inc</a>. 🕸</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to this humble blog.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to <a href="https://thewebb.blog" title="The awesome site you&#39;re on right now">theWebb.blog</a>! I am your host, the <em>most</em> <strong>fantabulous</strong> Paul Anthony Webb a/k/a NetOperator Wibby (virtually everywhere else on the vast Internet). What can you expect from theWebb.blog? Basically anything that comes out of my head and holds my attention long enough to be written about.</p>
<p>I thought about porting the posts from <a href="https://dsgn.io/thoughts" title="My old blog">my previous blog</a>, but I&#39;d rather start fresh. After all, after the <em>tumultuous</em> year that was 2016, I think we could <strong>all</strong> use a fresh start.</p>
<p>As a professional front-end web designer and developer, I thought about creating a beautiful theme to showcase my dope skills but I tend to go overboard and never release things. I&#39;m aiming to change that. I was also going to write my own blogging platform after my frustration and false start with <a href="https://ghost.org" title="Pretty good blogging software not on the latest Node.js">Ghost</a> but then I found <a href="https://hexo.io" title="Super hackable blogging software with questionable documentation">Hexo</a> (shoutout to the <a href="https://github.com/solkimicreb" title="Pretty cool guy">creator of NX framework</a> for the recommendation)!</p>
<p>Long story short, I intend to stick around with this blog for quote some time. Fancy upgrades and whatnot will happen over the next year and years after that. <a href="http://kottke.org" title="The original blogger, basically">Kottke</a> has been blogging since 2008. I graduated high school in 2006! <em>Crazy</em>.</p>
<p>I hope you&#39;ll find my little area on the Internet of interest at least a few times. 🕸</p>
